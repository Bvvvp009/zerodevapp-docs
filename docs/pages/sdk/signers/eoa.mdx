# Use an EOA with ZeroDev

An Externally Owned Account (EOA) is a standard Ethereum account operated via a private key. It's commonly used in wallets like MetaMask. ZeroDev is compatible with EOAs as signers, and the method of integrating an EOA varies based on your dApp's connection approach.

## Integration Methods
We'll explore three methods to integrate a signer with ZeroDev: using an EIP-1193 provider, using a viem WalletClient, and employing a Local Account.

### EIP-1193 Provider Integration
EIP-1193 is a standard interface for Ethereum providers, such as MetaMask or hardware wallets, where the key material is hosted externally rather than on the local client. ZeroDev supports creating a signer from any provider that implements this interface.

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@zerodev/presets/zerodev';
import { providerToSmartAccountSigner } from '@zerodev/sdk';
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains";

// `window.ethereum` is the provider object that is injected into the browser by a wallet, like metamask, that enables JSON RPC communication with the walelt.
const smartAccountSigner = await providerToSmartAccountSigner(window.ethereum);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```

### Viem Wallet Client Integration
A [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html) is an interface to interact with Ethereum Account(s) and provides the ability to retrieve accounts, execute transactions, sign messages, etc through Wallet Actions.

In this example, we assume that you have access to a WalletClient object.
```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@zerodev/presets/zerodev';
import { walletClientToSmartAccountSigner } from '@zerodev/sdk';

const smartAccountSigner = walletClientToSmartAccountSigner(walletClient);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```

### Local Account
A Local Account refers to an EOA where the private key is directly accessible on the client. In this example we assume you have access to the private key locally.

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from "@zerodev/presets/zerodev"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains"
import { Hex } from "viem"

// Create a signer
const signer = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex)

// Create a Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer,
})
```
