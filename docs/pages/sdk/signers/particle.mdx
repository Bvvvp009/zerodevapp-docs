# Use Particle Network with ZeroDev

[Particle Network](https://particle.network/) is an intent-centric, modular wallet-as-a-service (WaaS). By utilizing MPC-TSS for key management, Particle can streamline onboarding via familiar Web2 methods such as Google, emails, and phone numbers.

By combining ZeroDev with Particle, you can use Particle to enable a smooth social login experience, while using ZeroDev as the smart wallet to sponsor gas for users, batch transactions, and more.

## Set up

To use Particle Network with ZeroDev, first create an application that integrates with Particle Network.

- Refer to the [Particle Network documentation site](https://docs.particle.network/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Particle Network.
- For a quick start, Particle Network provides a guide, available [here](https://docs.particle.network/getting-started/get-started).

## Integration
Integrating ZeroDev with Particle Network is straightforward after setting up the project. Particle Network provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the Particle Network object
After following the Particle Network documentation, you will have access to a `ParticleProvider` object as shown below:

```typescript
import { ParticleNetwork } from "@particle-network/auth";
import { ParticleProvider } from "@particle-network/provider";

// Param options here will be specific to your project.  See the Particle docs for more info.
const particle = new ParticleNetwork({
  projectId,
  clientKey,
  appId,
  chainName,
  chainId,
});
const particleProvider = new ParticleProvider(particle.auth)
```

### Use with ZeroDev

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@zerodev/presets/zerodev';
import { providerToSmartAccountSigner } from '@zerodev/sdk';
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains';

// Convert the particleProvider to a SmartAccountSigner
const smartAccountSigner = await providerToSmartAccountSigner(particleProvider);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```
