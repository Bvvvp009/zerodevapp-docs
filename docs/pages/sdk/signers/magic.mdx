# Use Magic with ZeroDev

[Magic](https://magic.link/) is a popular embedded wallet provider that supports social logins. While social logins are great, your users still need to onramp in order to pay for gas, which introduces significant friction.

By combining ZeroDev with Magic, you can use Magic to enable a smooth social login experience, while using ZeroDev as the smart wallet to sponsor gas for users, batch transactions, and more.

You can check out Magic's [official ZeroDev guide](https://magic.link/docs/wallets/integrations/zerodev-account-abstraction), or keep reading our guide.

## Set up

To use Magic with ZeroDev, first create an application that integrates with Magic.

- Refer to the [Magic documentation site](https://magic.link/docs/home/welcome) for instructions on setting up an application with the Magic SDK.
- For a quick start, Magic provides a CLI to create a starter project, available [here](https://magic.link/docs/home/quickstart/cli).

## Integration

:::info
Check out [this example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-signer-examples/tree/main/magic) for custom integration with Magic.
:::

Integrating ZeroDev with Magic is straightforward after setting up the Magic SDK. Magic provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the Magic object

After following the Magic documentation, you will have access to a MagicBase object as shown below:

```typescript
import { Magic as MagicBase } from 'magic-sdk';

const magic = new MagicBase(process.env.MAGIC_API_KEY as string, {
  network: {
    rpcUrl: getNetworkUrl(),
    chainId: getChainId(),
  },
  extensions: [new AuthExtension(), new OAuthExtension()],
});
```

### Use with ZeroDev

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@zerodev/presets/zerodev';
import { providerToSmartAccountSigner } from 'permissionless';
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains';

// Get the Provider from Magic and convert it to a SmartAccountSigner
const magicProvider = await magic.wallet.getProvider();
const smartAccountSigner = await providerToSmartAccountSigner(magicProvider);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```
