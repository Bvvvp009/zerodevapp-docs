# Use Dynamic with kernel.js

[Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/) is an embedded wallet provider that enables users to generate wallets within your application using Social Logins, Email OTP, or Webauthn.

## Set up

To use Dynamic with ZeroDev, you have two options: Dynamic's native integration that utilizes ZeroDev, or a custom integration using Dynamic's Externally Owned Account (EOA) as a signer. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

### Native Integration
Dynamic natively supports account abstraction using ZeroDev. This integration allows you to sponsor gas fees, bundle transactions, recover and transfer accounts, utilize session keys.
- For more information and how to get started, visit the [Dynamic Account Abstraction documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/embedded-wallets/add-account-abstraction).

### Custom Integration
If you would like to use kernel.js directly with a Dynamic project, you can set up a custom integration using Dynamics's EOA as a signer.
- Begin by setting up your application with Dynamic, as detailed in the [Dynamic documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/introduction/welcome).
- Dynamic also offers a quick start guide and sample apps, available [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/quickstart).

## Implementing Custom Integration
Integrating kernel.js with Dynamic is straightforward once your application is set up. Dynamic provides an EOA wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Get the Dynamic wallet's Provider
To begin, ensure your application is integrated with Dynamic. Detailed guidance is available in the [Dynamic documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/). 

The following example demonstrates the use of Dynamic's React Core SDK. Ensure your React app is already configured with Dynamic; for setup instructions, refer to the [tutorial](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/tutorial).
```typescript
import { useDynamicContext } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";

// Use the `useDynamicContext` hook to get the primary wallet
const { primaryWallet } = useDynamicContext();

// Get the dynamicProvider, we will use in the next section
const dynamicProvider = await primaryWallet?.connector?.getWalletClient();
```

### Use with kernel.js

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@zerodev/presets/zerodev';
import { providerToSmartAccountSigner } from '@zerodev/sdk';
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains';

// Use the Provider from Dynamic to create a SmartAccountSigner
const smartAccountSigner = await providerToSmartAccountSigner(dynamicProvider);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```
