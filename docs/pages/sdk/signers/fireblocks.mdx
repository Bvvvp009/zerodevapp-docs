# Use Fireblocks with ZeroDev

[Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/) is a user-friendly platform designed for building blockchain-based products and managing digital asset operations. It uses a direct custody approach, combining high performance with zero counterparty risk and multi-layered security. The platform includes secure MPC-based digital asset wallets, a policy engine for governance and transaction rules, and comprehensive treasury management. Fireblocks' security framework features multiple layers, including MPC-CMP technology, secure enclaves, and a robust policy engine, ensuring protection against cyberattacks, internal threats, and human errors. It's widely used for various operations like treasury, trading, and managing NFTs, smart contracts, and user wallets.

## Set up

To use Fireblocks with ZeroDev, first create an application that integrates with Fireblocks.

- Refer to the [Fireblocks documentation site](https://developers.fireblocks.com/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Fireblocks.
- For a quick start, Fireblocks provides a guide, available [here](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/quickstart).

## Integration
Integrating ZeroDev with Fireblocks is straightforward after setting up the project. Fireblocks provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the Fireblocks object
After following the Fireblocks documentation, you will have access to a `FireblocksWeb3Provider` object as shown below:

```typescript
import { FireblocksWeb3Provider, type FireblocksProviderConfig } from "@fireblocks/fireblocks-web3-provider";

// Config options here will be specific to your project.  See the Fireblocks docs for more info.
const fireblocksProviderConfig: FireblocksProviderConfig = { ... };
const fireblocksWeb3Provider = new FireblocksWeb3Provider(fireblocksProviderConfig);
```

### Use with ZeroDev

Use the provider from Fireblocks to create a smart account signer, which can be passed to a validator. For detailed guidance on using a validator, refer to our documentation on [creating accounts](/sdk/core-api/create-account#api).

```typescript
import { signerToEcdsaValidator } from "@zerodev/ecdsa-validator"
import { KERNEL_V3_1, getEntryPoint } from "@zerodev/sdk/constants"
import { createPublicClient } from "viem";
import { polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains';

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  transport: http('https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology'),
  chain: polygonAmoy,
})

// Pass your `smartAccountSigner` to the validator
const ecdsaValidator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: fireblocksWeb3Provider,
  entryPoint: getEntryPoint("0.7"),
  kernelVersion: KERNEL_V3_1
})

// You can now use this ECDSA Validator to create a Kernel account

```
