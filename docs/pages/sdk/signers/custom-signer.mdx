# Custom Signer Integration
ZeroDev offers the flexibility to integrate various types of signers, catering to diverse application requirements.

## Using Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)
Most commonly used signers are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). If you're using a signer that falls under this category and isn't explicitly covered in our documentation, we recommend visiting our dedicated [EOA integration section](/sdk/signers/eoa). This section provides detailed guidance on integrating EOAs with ZeroDev.

## Implementing Custom Signers

If your requirements extend beyond standard EOAs, ZeroDev supports the integration of custom signers. Our signers conform to the `SmartAccountSigner` interface defined in permissionless.js. For developers looking to implement a custom solution, you can reference the `SmartAccountSigner` interface on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/permissionless.js/blob/0b1cf0086b3fa131415a6a9bf398852c159fc181/packages/permissionless/accounts/types.ts#L60). This interface provides the necessary structure and guidelines to ensure compatibility with ZeroDev.

One easy way to implement a `SmartAccountSigner` is to implement Viem's account type, [by following this guide](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/local/toAccount).

Once you've implemented the signer, you should be able to [use it with a validator](/sdk/core-api/create-account#creating-a-ecdsa-validator).
