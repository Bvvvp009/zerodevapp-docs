# ZeroDev Tutorial

Impatient?  Check out [the complete example here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/tree/main/tutorial/completed.ts).

In this tutorial, we will mint an NFT without paying gas. We assume that you have a high-level understanding of AA concepts such as bundlers, paymasters, and UserOp; if not, read [the introduction](/) first.

## Create a ZeroDev Project

ZeroDev works with any bundlers and paymasters.  For this tutorial, we will use ZeroDev's [meta AA infra](/meta-infra/intro).

Go to the [ZeroDev dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/) and create a project for Polygon Mumbai.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/dashboard_create_project.png" width="50%" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/dashboard_project_home.png" width="50%" />
</p>

We will be using the "Project ID" in the next steps.

## Set up a gas policy

With ZeroDev, by default you are not sponsoring UserOps.  To sponsor UserOps, you need to set up a gas policy.

Go to the "Gas Policies" section of your dashboard and create a new "Project Policy":

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/project_policy.png" width="80%" />
</p>

From now on, when you use the paymaster RPC from the previous step, the paymaster will sponsor UserOps according to the policy you just set up, which in this case is up to 100 UserOps per minute.

## Write the code

Clone the [ZeroDev examples repo](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples).  Then, inside the directory, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with the following line:

```env
ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

Replacing `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your actual project ID from the dashboard, and make sure you are using a project ID for Polygon Mumbai.

If all goes well, you should be able to run:

```bash
npx ts-node tutorial/completed.ts
```

Now open the [`tutorial/template.ts`](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/tutorial/template.ts) file in your editor.  This will be the template where you will write your code.  You can always refer to [`tutorial/completed.ts`](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/tutorial/completed.ts) to see the completed tutorial code.

### Creating a Kernel client

Before you can send UserOps, you need to construct an "account client."  An account client is an object that interacts with a bundler on behalf of a specific account.  In the case of ZeroDev, all account clients are of the type `KernelAccountClient`.

There are several types of Kernel account clients, each for a different type of [validation methods](/sdk/plugins/intro).  For this tutorial, we will be using the most common validation method -- ECDSA, which is the same algorithm used by normal Ethereum accounts (EOAs).

ECDSA accounts are controlled by a private key.  For this tutorial, we will use a random private key.  Add the following import and code:

```typescript
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"

const main = async () => {
  const privateKey = generatePrivateKey()
  const signer = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey)
}
```

Since we are using ZeroDev for bundlers & paymasters, we can construct the Kernel client via the ZeroDev "preset."  Presets are helper functions for specific infra providers.  Add the following import and code:

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from "@zerodev/presets/zerodev"
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains"

const main = async () => {
  // ... other code

  const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
    chain: polygonMumbai,
    projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID!,
    signer,
  })

  const accountAddress = kernelClient.account.address
  console.log("My account:", accountAddress)
}
```

Run this script with `npx ts-node tutorial/template.ts` and confirm that it prints an address.

### Send a UserOp

Now that you have an account client, it's time to send your first UserOp!  For this tutorial, we will mint an NFT from a contract deployed on Polygon Mumbai.

Add the following import and code:

```typescript
import { encodeFunctionData } from "viem"

const main = async () => {
  // ... other code

  const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
    userOperation: {
      callData: await kernelClient.account.encodeCallData({
        to: contractAddress,
        value: BigInt(0),
        data: encodeFunctionData({
          abi: contractABI,
          functionName: "mint",
          args: [accountAddress],
        })
      })
    }
  })
  console.log("Submitted UserOp:", userOpHash)
}
```

There's quite a bit of code going on, so let's go through it.

- We start by calling `kernelClient.sendUserOperation`, which takes a `userOperation` argument.
- Inside `userOperation`, we specify a `callData` field.  This is the equivalent of the calldata field for a normal Ethereum transaction.
- Since we want to call the `mint(address)` function on the NFT contract, we use Viem's helper function `encodeFunctionData` and give it the ABI, function name, and function argument.
- `kernelClient.sendUserOperation` returns a "UserOperation hash."  This is the equivalent of a transaction hash but for a UserOp.

Run the script again with `npx ts-node tutorial/template.ts` and confirm that it prints the UserOp hash.  At this point, you can go to a UserOp explorer such as [JiffyScan](https://jiffyscan.xyz/) and find your UserOp with the hash!

### Waiting for the UserOp

When you call `sendUserOperation`, the call returns as soon as the UserOp has been submitted to the bundler, but it doesn't wait for the UserOp to be "confirmed" on-chain.  To wait for the UserOp to be confirmed, add the following import and code:

```typescript
import { bundlerActions } from "permissionless"

const main = async () => {
  // ... other code

  const bundlerClient = kernelClient.extend(bundlerActions)

  const receipt = await bundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
    hash: userOpHash,
  })
  console.log("UserOp confirmed:", receipt.userOpHash)
}
```

Let's break down the code:

- Since `waitForUserOperationReceipt` is a bundler action, we need to first `extend` the `kernelClient` with `bundlerActions`.  If you are unfamiliar with the concept of "actions," you can read more about it on [Viem's documentation](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/introduction).
- Now, we can call `waitForUserOperationReceipt`.  This function returns a "receipt" object.  If you are curious, you can print the full object and see what it contains.

### Read contract state

Now let's confirm that we actually minted an NFT.  Add the following import and code:

```typescript
import { publicActions } from "viem"

const main = async () => {
  // ... other code

  const publicClient = kernelClient.extend(publicActions)

  const nftBalance = await publicClient.readContract({
    address: contractAddress,
    abi: contractABI,
    functionName: 'balanceOf',
    args: [accountAddress],
  })
  console.log(`NFT balance: ${nftBalance}`)
}
```

Run the script again.  You should see that it prints `NFT balance: 1`, confirming that you have minted an NFT! 

## Next steps

In this tutorial, we were able to mint an NFT without paying gas, thanks to gas sponsorship.
