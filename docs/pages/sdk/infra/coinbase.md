# Coinbase Developer Platform

[Coinbase Developer Platform](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/) offers bundler and paymaster services that you can use with ZeroDev.

Generally speaking, Coinbase bundlers & paymasters speak the same interface as Pimlico, so you can refer to [this guide](/sdk/infra/pimlico).  You can also refer to [CDP's official examples for ZeroDev](https://github.com/coinbase/paymaster-bundler-examples/tree/master/examples/zerodev).
