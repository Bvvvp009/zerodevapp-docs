# Getting Started with Permissions

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create composable permissions.

We will create what's commonly known as a "session key" -- a key that can only do specific things under specific conditions.  Here, we will create a key that can only mint an NFT, and only mint it once.

## Setup

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-and-installation) to clone and set up the ZeroDev examples repo.

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to run one of the example scripts, like:

```bash
npx ts-node create-account/main.ts
```

Now, open `permissions/tutorial.ts` in an editor.

## Installation

The examples repo already installed this, but normally you would install permissions with:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @zerodev/permissions
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zerodev/permissions
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @zerodev/permissions
```

```bash [bun]
bun i @zerodev/permissions
```

## API

With a permissions validator, you are putting together:

- One signer
- Any number of policies
- (optionally) one action

Let's first look at an example:

```typescript
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
    regular: await toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
      entryPoint,
      signer: ecdsaSigner,
      policies: [
        toGasPolicy({
          allowed: BigInt(0),
          enforcePaymaster: true,
        }),
        toCallPolicy({
          permissions: [
            {
              abi: contractABI,
              target: contractAddress,
              functionName: "mint",
            },
          ],
        }),
      ],
    }),
    entryPoint,
  },
  entryPoint,
})
```

Now let's break it down:

### Creating a signer



### Creating a number of policies
