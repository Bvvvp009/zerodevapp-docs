# Presets

ZeroDev is highly modular and composable thanks to building on top of Viem and Permissionless, but sometimes it can feel like you are writing a lot of boilerplate code before you can set up a functional Kernel account.  **Presets** are helper functions that help you set up Kernel accounts with common configurations, including connections to bundlers and paymasters.

Generally speaking, there will be a preset for each `<infra provider, account type>` pair.  For example, the `<zerodev, ecdsa>` preset will create a ECDSA Kernel account using ZeroDev's infrastructure.
