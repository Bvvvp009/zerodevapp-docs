# Cross-chain transactions

:::info
This feature is in public beta and undergoing audit.  Please [contact us](https://t.me/derek_chiang) if you plan on going live with it.

ZeroDev is the first smart account solution to support *cross-chain transactions*.  Sometimes this is also referred to as "chain abstraction."

More specifically, a ZeroDev smart account can use its tokens from one chain on another chain, without bridging.  Some examples are:

- Stake ETH on Ethereum mainnet using ETH on Polygon.
- Spend USDC on Base to purchase an NFT sold in USDT on Arbitrum.
- Execute a transaction on Blast by paying gas in DAI from Optimism.

## Features

### Cross-chain without bridging

Don't ask your users to visit a bridge.  With ZeroDev, your users can make cross-chain transactions just like how they make normal transactions, without ever leaving your app.

### Unparalleled speed

Cross-chain transactions with ZeroDev are very fast, thanks to *intents* -- solvers compete on the destination chain to fill your intents as quickly as possible.

### Deep liquidity

Most "chain abstraction" solutions on the market are toys that fail under any real amount of traffic.  ZeroDev's cross-chain transactions network is built on top of protocols with the deepest liquidity, such as Across, Relay, and Meson.

## Code example

Here is a [complete code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/intent/main.ts) for using CAB.  You can run the example by cloning the repo.

## Usage

We highly recommend that you use the code example above as a reference as you follow this guide.

### Setting up the Kernel account

First, make sure you know how to [create ZeroDev accounts](/sdk/core-api/create-account).

The flow for creating a chain-abstracted ZeroDev account is the same, with the following exceptions:

- For your `kernelVersion`, make sure to use `KERNEL_V3_2`.

```ts
const kernelVersion = KERNEL_V3_2;
```

- When setting up a `kernelAccount`, use the following configuration:

```ts

import { installIntentExecutor } from '@zerodev/intent'

const kernelAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
  },
  kernelVersion,
  entryPoint,
  initConfig: [installIntentExecutor]
})
```

- Instead of using the normal `createKernelAccountClient`, use `createIntentClient` instead:

```ts
const intentClient = createIntentClient({
  chain,
  account: kernelAccount,
  bundlerTransport: http(bundlerRpc),
})
```

### Sending cross-chain transactions

The `intentClient` supports all regular APIs that a regular ZeroDev client supports, such as `sendUserOperation` and `sendTransaction` for sending transactions on the same chain.

For cross-chain transactions, the `intentClient` implements an API that is beautifully simple:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  calls: [
    // ...
  ],
  inputTokens: [
    // ...
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    // ...
  ],
})
```

- `calls` is a batch of calls to be executed atomically on the target chain.  Each `call` specifies a `to`, `value`, and `data`.

- `inputTokens` is a list of input tokens to be debited (spent by the user) from the source chain(s).

- `outputTokens` is a list of output tokens to be credited (provided by a solver) on the target chain.

Here's a real example for using USDC on Arbitrum to execute a transaction on Base:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  calls: [
    {
      // USDC on base
      to: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913',
      value: BigInt(0),
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [account.address, parseUnits('1', 6)],
      }),
    },
  ],
  inputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: arbitrum.id,
      address: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on arb
    },
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: base.id,
      address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on base
      amount: parseUnits('1', 6), // 1 USDC
    },
  ],
})
```

Two important things to note:

- You do NOT need to explicitly pay gas when you send a cross-chain transaction.  The gas is automatically accounted for as a part of your input tokens.

- You do NOT need to specify an amount for your `inputTokens`.  Your input token amount is estimated from your output token amount, plus gas.
  - For example, if you specify your input token as `USDC` and you want to spend (output) 100 USDC, and the gas fee is worth 0.1 USDC, then your input token will be automatically set to 100.1 USDC, plus a little fees for the solver.

## Supported tokens and networks

Feel free to reach out to us with the link on top of this page if you want to see more tokens or networks supported.

### Mainnet

In the beta testing phase, we support only **USDC, USDT, and ETH** for cross-chain transactions, on the following networks:

- Ethereum mainnet
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Base
- Polygon
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

We will support all popular tokens when we enter production.

### Testnet

We support **USDC and ETH** on the following testnets:

- Ethereum Sepolia
- Base Sepolia
