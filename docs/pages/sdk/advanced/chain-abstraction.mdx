# Chain Abstraction

ZeroDev is the first smart account solution to support *chain abstraction*.

With ZeroDev, you can turn a token balance into a "**chain-abstracted balance**" (CAB).  Instead of thinking about "USDC on Ethereum" vs "USDC on Arbitrum," your user can just look at their "USDC balance" as a single balance that can be spent on any chain.

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC to a Yi account on Base, then deposit 200 USDC to the account on Polygon, the account will now hold 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" that can be spent on any chain.

Amazingly, these chain-abstracted tokens can be spent at the speed of the destination chain -- just like a regular transaction. This is unlike a traditional bridge where the user has to wait for confirmations on both the source chain and the destination chain.

## Code example

You can refer to [this code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/chain-abstraction/main.ts) for using CAB.

## Usage

### Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @zerodev/cab
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zerodev/cab
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @zerodev/cab
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @zerodev/cab
```

### Setting up the Kernel account

For the best experience with CAB, we recommend setting up your Kernel account with the *multi-chain ECDSA validator*:

```tsx
const ecdsaValidator = await toMultiChainECDSAValidator(publicClient, {
  signer,
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
})
```

Then you can [set up a Kernel client with this validator as usual](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-a-kernel-account).

If you are looking to enable CAB for accounts using [the regular ECDSA validator](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/core-api/create-account#creating-a-ecdsa-validator) or another validator, [get in touch](https://t.me/derek_chiang).

### Setting up the CAB client

To use CAB, wrap the kernel client into a CAB client:

```tsx
const cabClient = createKernelCABClient(kernelClient, {
  transport: http(CAB_PAYMASTER_URL),
})
```

Note that since CAB is in private alpha, you need to contact us to obtain the CAB paymaster URL.

### Enabling chain-abstracted balance

Before using CAB, you need to enable CAB for the smart account, by specifying a list of tokens you wish to support.  Currently, CAB supports USDC only.  Please let us know if there are specific tokens you wish us to support.

```tsx
await cabClient.enableCAB({
  tokens: [{
    name: "USDC",
    // networks: [arbitrum.id, base.id],
  }]
})
```

You can optionally specify the list of networks to enable CAB for.  If you don't specify it, CAB is enabled for all supported networks, which currently includes:

- Ethereum mainnet
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Base
- Polygon

### Spending chain-abstracted balance

There are three steps to spending CAB:

- Construct the calls
- Prepare the CAB UserOp and token info
- Send the UserOp

First, start by constructing the calls.  You can include multiple calls if you'd like to send a batch.

```tsx
// In this example, we are performing a USDC transfer
const calls = [
  {
    to: usdcContractAddress,
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: erc20Abi,
      functionName: "transfer",
      args: [account.address, BigInt(1000)]
    }),
    value: BigInt(0),
  }
]
```

Then, prepare the CAB UserOp.  Here you need to decide which tokens on which chain you'd like to "repay" with.

```tsx
const repayTokens = [
  {
    address: supportedTokens.USDC[42161].token,
    chainId: 42161
  }
]

const { userOperation, repayTokensInfo, sponsorTokensInfo } =
  await cabClient.prepareUserOperationRequestCAB({
    account: cabClient.account,
    transactions: calls,
    repayTokens: repayTokens
  })
```
