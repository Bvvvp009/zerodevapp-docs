# Chain Abstraction

ZeroDev is the first smart account solution to support *chain abstraction*.

With ZeroDev, you can turn a token balance into a "**chain-abstracted balance**" (CAB).  Instead of thinking about "USDC on Ethereum" vs "USDC on Arbitrum," your user can just look at their "USDC balance" as a single balance that can be spent on any chain.

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC to a Yi account on Base, then deposit 200 USDC to the account on Polygon, the account will now hold 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" that can be spent on any chain.

Amazingly, these chain-abstracted tokens can be spent at the speed of the destination chain -- just like a regular transaction. This is unlike a traditional bridge where the user has to wait for confirmations on both the source chain and the destination chain.

## Code example

Here's a [complete code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/chain-abstraction/main.ts) for using CAB.  To run the example you need to set the environment variable `CAB_PAYMASTER_URL`, which you can obtain from Derek.

## Usage

### Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @zerodev/cab
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zerodev/cab
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @zerodev/cab
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @zerodev/cab
```

### Setting up the Kernel account

For the best experience with CAB, we recommend setting up your Kernel account with a *multi-chain validator*, which is a [validator](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/core-api/using-plugins) that can sign messages for multiple chains in one signature.  This is useful for CAB because CAB needs to be enabled for each chain, so with a multi-chain validator you can enable CAB with just one signature, whereas with a regular validator you'd need to sign once per chain.

To set up a multi-chain ECDSA validator:

```tsx
import { toMultiChainECDSAValidator } from "@zerodev/multi-chain-validator"

const ecdsaValidator = await toMultiChainECDSAValidator(publicClient, {
  signer,
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
})
```

To set up a multi-chain passkeys validator, check out [this example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/build-with-yi/blob/45ca61968de9ff39244687796bc69e09586a4421/packages/wagmi/src/provider/helpers/initializeClientsFromPasskey.ts#L55-L84).

Once you have created a validator, you can [set up a Kernel client with this validator as usual](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-a-kernel-account).

### Setting up the CAB client

To use CAB, wrap the kernel client into a CAB client:

```tsx
const cabClient = createKernelCABClient(kernelClient, {
  transport: http(CAB_PAYMASTER_URL),
})
```

Note that since CAB is in private alpha, you need to contact us to obtain the CAB paymaster URL.

### Enabling chain-abstracted balance

Before using CAB, you need to enable CAB for the smart account, by specifying a list of tokens you wish to support.  Currently, CAB supports USDC only.  Please let us know if there are specific tokens you wish us to support.

```tsx
await cabClient.enableCAB({
  tokens: [{
    name: "USDC",
    // networks: [arbitrum.id, base.id],
  }]
})
```

You can optionally specify the list of networks to enable CAB for.  If you don't specify it, CAB is enabled for all supported networks.

If you are not using a multi-chain validator, you need to enableCAB for each network, one at a time:

```tsx
await cabClient.enableCAB({
  tokens: [{
    name: "USDC",
    networks: [arbitrum.id],
  }]
})
```

### Spending chain-abstracted balance

There are three steps to spending CAB:

- Construct the calls
- Prepare the CAB UserOp and token info
- Send the UserOp

First, start by constructing the calls.  You can include multiple calls if you'd like to send a batch.

```tsx
// In this example, we are performing a USDC transfer
const calls = [
  {
    to: usdcContractAddress,
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: erc20Abi,
      functionName: "transfer",
      args: [account.address, BigInt(1000)]
    }),
    value: BigInt(0),
  }
]
```

Then, prepare the CAB UserOp by specifying the calls and repay tokens.  Repay tokens are the tokens the users will repay the solvers with.  Since CAB only supports USDC for now, both repay tokens and sponsor tokens (the tokens provided to the user by solvers) will be USDC, but in principle repay tokens and sponsor tokens can be different.  For example, a user might spend WETH while paying users back in USDC.

```tsx
const { userOperation, repayTokensInfo, sponsorTokensInfo } =
  await cabClient.prepareUserOperationRequestCAB({
    calls,
    repayTokens: ['USDC'],
  })
```

Here you have three pieces of data which you can display to users for them to confirm the transaction, if you wish:

- `userOperation` is the full UserOp that will be sent.
- `repayTokensInfo` is information for the repay tokens (the tokens the user is paying solvers)
- `sponsorTokensInfo` is information for the sponsor tokens (the tokens the user is spending, aka the tokens paid by solvers)

Finally, send the CAB UserOp:

```tsx
const userOpHash = await cabClient.sendUserOperationCAB({
  userOperation,
})
```

### Reading chain-abstracted balance

To read the CAB balance for an account:

```tsx
const cabBalance = await cabClient.getCabBalance({
  address: account.address,
  token: 'USDC',
})
```
