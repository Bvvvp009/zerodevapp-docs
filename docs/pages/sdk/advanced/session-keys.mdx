In EntryPoint 0.7 (Kernel v3), session keys have been upgraded into a more powerful "permissions system."  [Please refer to these docs.](/sdk/permissions/intro)

## EntryPoint v0.6 (Kernel v2)

:::

The following document is for session keys for EntryPoint 0.6 (Kernel v2).  If you are using EntryPoint 0.7 (Kernel v3), [please refer to permissions instead.](/sdk/permissions/intro)

Session keys are keys assigned with specific permissions.  Some examples are:

- A key that can only interact with Uniswap
- A key that can only use up to 1000 USDC
- A key that expires in 3 days

Of course, the permissions can be composed, so you can create a key that can only interact with Uniswap, while only using up to 1000 USDC, while expiring in 3 days, for instance.

Session keys have two primary use cases:

- **Skipping confirmations**: if you don't want your users to have to confirm every single transaction, you can create a session key that's only allowed to send specific transactions, and store the key in local storage.  Now, your user can interact with your app with the session key without dealing with signing prompts.  This experience is sometimes known as "one-click trading."

- **Automating transactions**: if you want to execute transactions for your users automatically, they can create a session key and give it to you.  You can then store the session keys on your server and execute transactions for your users.  Your users don't have to fully trust you since the session keys are bounded by permissions.

The possibility with transaction automation is endless.  Some examples are:

- Subscriptions
- Stop orders
- Automatically paying back loans when the user is in danger of liquidation

## API

When using session keys, it's helpful to distinguish between the **owner** and the **agent**.

- The **owner** is whoever controls the master key of the account.  The owner is the person that is able to create session keys.
- The **agent** is whoever using the session key.

There are two typical flows for how the owner and the agent interact:

- **Owner-created**: The owner creates the session key and shares it with the agent.

- **Agent-created**: The agent creates a key pair and shares the public key with the owner.  The owner creates a partial session key based on the public key, then shares the partial session key with the agent.  Finally, the agent combines the private key wih the partial session key to form a full session key.

Let's walk through how each flow works.

### Owner-created

:::info
Check out [the code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/session-keys/owner-created.ts) for the owner-created pattern.
:::

We assume that you have [created a Kernel account](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-a-kernel-account).  If you only have a `kernelClient`, the Kernel account can be accessed as `kernelClient.account`.

First, create a signer for the session key:

```typescript
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"

const sessionPrivateKey = generatePrivateKey()
const sessionKeySigner = privateKeyToAccount(sessionPrivateKey)
```

Note that while we are using a local private key in this example, the session key signer can be any [Viem account object](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/local).

Now, create a session key validator:

```typescript
const sessionKeyValidator = await signerToSessionKeyValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: sessionKeySigner,
  validatorData: {
    // Set session key params
  },
})
```

:::info
Refer to [the session key params section](#session-key-parameters) to learn about session key params.
:::

Now, construct a Kernel account using your sudo validator and the session key validator:

```typescript
const sessionKeyAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
    regular: sessionKeyValidator,
  },
})
```

In this example, the sudo validator is `ecdsaValidator`.

If you want to use the session key on the same node, you can already [construct a Kernel client from this Kernel account](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-an-account-client) and start using it.  If you want to share the session key with an agent or store it for use later, you can serialize the session key:

```typescript
import { serializeSessionKeyAccount } from "@zerodev/session-key"

const serializedSessionKey = await serializeSessionKeyAccount(sessionKeyAccount, sessionPrivateKey)
```

Now, when the agent needs to use the session key (or when you want to use your stored session key later), deserialize it:

```typescript
const sessionKeyAccount = await deserializeSessionKeyAccount(publicClient, serializedSessionKey)
```

Now you can [create a Kernel client](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-an-account-client) using the `sessionKeyAccount` as you normally would.

### Agent-created

:::info
Check out [the code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/session-keys/agent-created.ts) for the agent-created pattern.
:::

In the agent-created pattern, the agent creates a public-private key pair and shares the public key with the owner.  The owner authorizes the public key (by signing it), and shares the signed data with the agent.  Finally, the agent creates the full session key by combining the signed data with the private key.  This pattern is powerful because **the agent never had to share the private part of the session key with anyone**.

First, the agent creates a key pair:

```typescript
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"

const sessionPrivateKey = generatePrivateKey()
const sessionKeySigner = privateKeyToAccount(sessionPrivateKey)
const sessionKeyAddress = sessionKeySigner.address
```

Note that while we are using a local private key in this example, the session key signer can be any [Viem account object](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/local).

Then, the agent shares the public key (address) of this signer with the owner.  In this case, it would be `sessionKeySigner.address`.

With this address, the owner can authorize the session key as such:

```typescript
// Construct an "empty signer" that only has the address
const emptySessionKeySigner = addressToEmptyAccount(sessionKeyAddress)

const sessionKeyValidator = await signerToSessionKeyValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: emptySessionKeySigner,
  validatorData: {
    // Set session key params
  },
})
```

:::info
Refer to [the session key params section](#session-key-parameters) to learn about session key params.
:::

Now, the owner can construct a Kernel account using the sudo validator and the session key validator:

```typescript
const sessionKeyAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
    regular: sessionKeyValidator,
  },
})
```

Finally, the owner can serialize the session key and share it with the agent.

```typescript
import { serializeSessionKeyAccount } from "@zerodev/session-key"

const serializedSessionKey = await serializeSessionKeyAccount(sessionKeyAccount)
```

Now, when the agent needs to use the session key, they deserialize it:

```typescript
const sessionKeyAccount = await deserializeSessionKeyAccount(publicClient, serializedSessionKey, sessionKeySigner)
```

Note how we pass `sessionKeySigner` to `deserializeSessionKeyAccount`.  This is the private part of the session key that only the agent knows about.

Now you can [create a Kernel client](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-an-account-client) using the `sessionKeyAccount` as you normally would.

### Revoking Session Keys

```typescript
import { revokeSessionKey } from "@zerodev/session-key"

// Revoke all session keys
const userOpHash = await revokeSessionKey(kernelClient)

// Revoke a specific session key
const userOpHash = await revokeSessionKey(kernelClient, sessionKeySigner.address)
```

Note that `kernelClient` in this case must be using the master signer (instead of the session key signer).  If you want to revoke session keys using the session key signer itself, you must explicitly set up the session key permissions so that it's allowed to revoke itself.  You can do so by including this permission:

```ts
import { SESSION_KEY_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS } from "@zerodev/session-key"
import { parseAbi } from "viem"

const sessionKeyValidator = await signerToSessionKeyValidator(publicClient, {
  // other options...

  validatorData: {
    // other options...

    permissions: [
      // other permissions...

      // Allow the session key to revoke itself
      {
        target: SESSION_KEY_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS,
        abi: parseAbi([
          'function disable(bytes calldata _data)',
        ]),
        functionName: 'disable',
        args: [
          {
            operator: ParamOperator.EQUAL,
            value: sessionKeySigner.address,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

## Session Key Parameters

When creating a session key validator, you specify parameters under the `validatorData` flag:

```typescript
const sessionKeyValidator = await signerToSessionKeyValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: sessionKeySigner,
  validatorData: {
    validUntil,
    validAfter,
    paymaster,
    permissions,
  },
})
```

Now we go over each parameter.

### `validUntil`

`validUntil` is a UNIX timestamp (in seconds) that specifies when the session key should expire.

If not set or set to `0`, then the session key will never expire.

### `validAfter`

`validAfter` is a UNIX timestamp (in seconds) that specifies when the session key should start taking effect.

If not set or set to `0`, then the session key will be valid immediately.

### `paymaster`

`paymaster` specifies whether the session key must be used with a paymaster.  **It's highly recommended that you set this flag unless 1) you fully trust the agent holding the session key, or 2) you don't expect your users to hold any ETH (or whatever native token for the network).**  Otherwise, a malicious agent can set arbitrarily high gas price for UserOps sent with the session key, and then submit the UserOps themselves in order to profit from the gas, completely draining the user of ETH in the process.

By setting the `paymaster` flag to a non-zero value, you ensure that the session key can only be used with a paymaster, and the paymaster (if properly set up) should have defense against arbitrarily high gas prices.

If not set or set to `address(0)` (you can use `zeroAddress` from `viem`), the session key will work with or without paymaster.

If set to `address(1)` (you can use `oneAddress` from `@zerodev/session-key`), the session key will only work with a paymaster, but it can be any paymaster.

If set to a specific paymaster address, then the session key can only be used with that paymaster.

### `permissions`

Permissions are at the core of session keys.  By specifying permissions, you limit the types of transactions that the session key can send.

Permissions look like this:

```typescript
import { ParamOperator } from "@zerodev/session-key"

const sessionKeyValidator = await signerToSessionKeyValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: sessionKeySigner,
  validatorData: {
    permissions: [
      {
        // Target contract to interact with
        target: contractAddress,

        // Maximum value that can be transferred.  In this case we
        // set it to zero so that no value transfer is possible.
        valueLimit: 0,

        // Contract ABI
        abi: contractABI,

        // Function name
        functionName: 'mint',

        // An array of conditions, each corresponding to an argument for
        // the function.
        args: [
          {
            // Argument operator and value.
            operator: ParamOperator.EQUAL,
            value: argumentValue,
          }
        ],

        // (optional) whether this is a call or a delegatecall.  Defaults to call
        operation: Operation.Call,
      },
      {
        // another permission...
      },
    ]
  },
})
```

Here's what each flag means:

- `target`: the target contract to call or address to send ETH to.  If this is `zeroAddress`, then the target can be any contract as long as the ABI matches (or it can be any address if no ABI is specified).
- `valueLimit`: the maximum [value](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-transaction#:~:text=The%20value%20is%20the%20amount%20of%20Ether%20to%20transfer%20from%20the%20sender%20to%20the%20recipient%2C%20and%20this%20can%20even%20be%20zero.) that can be transmitted.
- `abi`: the contract ABI
- `functionName`: the function name
- `args`: an array of conditions, each corresponding to an argument, in the order that the arguments are laid out.  use `null` to skip an argument.
  - `operator`: this can be `EQUAL`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `NOT_EQUAL`.
  - `value`: the value of the argument to use with the operator.  For instance, `operator = EQUAL` and `value = 2` would mean "the value must be equal to 2".
- `operation`: (optional) whether this is a call or a delegatecall.  Defaults to call.

### Batching and Delegatecall

To use session keys with [batching](/sdk/core-api/batch-transactions), specify the following `action` when constructing the account:

```ts
import { zeroAddress, toFunctionSelector } from "viem"
import { KernelAccountAbi } from "@zerodev/sdk"

const sessionKeyAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
    regular: sessionKeyValidator,
    action: {  // [!code focus]
      address: zeroAddress,  // [!code focus]
      selector: toFunctionSelector(getAbiItem({ abi: KernelAccountAbi, name: "executeBatch" })),  // [!code focus]
    },  // [!code focus]
  },
})
```

Then you can send batched UserOps with `sendUserOperation([userops])` as usual.

To use session keys with `delegatecall`:

```ts
import { zeroAddress, toFunctionSelector } from "viem"

const sessionKeyAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
    regular: sessionKeyValidator,
    action: { // [!code focus]
      address: zeroAddress, // [!code focus]
      selector: toFunctionSelector("executeDelegateCall(address, bytes)"), // [!code focus]
    }, // [!code focus]
  },
})
```

### Transferring ETH

If you want to transfer ETH with a session key, specify the `data` field as such:

```ts
import { pad } from 'viem'

await sessionKeyAccountClient.sendTransaction({
  to: address,
  data: pad("0x", { size: 4 }),
  value: amountToTransfer,
})
```

## FAQs

### Does creating session keys cost gas?

No.  Creating a session key entails simply signing a message, which is done off-chain and doesn't involve any gas cost.

### Is it possible to use session keys with a not-yet-deployed account?

Yes.  If you do so, the first UserOp sent with the session key will deploy the account.
