# DeFi Integrations

With our DeFi integrations, you will be able to use the ZeroDev SDK to easily enter/exit DeFi positions (e.g. lending and staking) as well as swapping tokens.  Everything can be done in one single UserOp thanks to [batching](/sdk/core-api/batch-transactions).

Note that this is purely whitelabeled -- we only take care of the underlying UserOps.  You build your own UI.

This feature is currently in beta.  Please email `hello@zerodev.app` to request access.
