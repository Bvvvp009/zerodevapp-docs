`delegatecall` is a powerful EVM opcode that allows the calling contract to execute code in another contract, while keeping the storage context.  [You can read more about `delegatecall` here](https://solidity-by-example.org/delegatecall/).


## API

To send a UserOp that uses `delegatecall`, simply specify the `callType` of the UserOp:


```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
  userOperation: {
    callData: await kernelClient.account.encodeCallData({
      to: targetAdress,
      data: callData,
      callType: "delegatecall",
    }),
  },
})
```
