# Sponsoring Gas

With account abstraction, you can pay gas for users so they don't have to acquire native tokens in order to interact with your DApp.

When you sponsor gas through ZeroDev, there are two ways to pay for the gas:

- Put down your credit card.  We front the gas for your users, and then at the end of the billing cycle (once a month) we charge your credit card.

- Buy gas credits from us.

## Setting up gas sponsoring policies

To avoid over-spending gas on sponsoring, you must set up gas-sponsoring policies.  Sign up on the ZeroDev dashboard if you haven't already, then [set up gas policies](/meta-infra/gas-policies).

## API

Impatient?  Check out [complete examples here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/create-account/main.ts).

When [setting up an account](/sdk/core-api/create-account), you can specify a `getPaymasterData` function in `paymaster` when you [create the account client](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-an-account-client).

The `getPaymasterData` function essentially takes a UserOp and then returns a UserOp with the `paymasterAndData` field set.  For example, if you are using the ZeroDev paymaster, use the `createZeroDevPaymasterClient` helper function:

```typescript
import { http } from "viem"
import { createZeroDevPaymasterClient, createKernelAccountClient } from "@zerodev/sdk"
import { getEntryPoint } from "@zerodev/sdk/constants"

const entryPoint = getEntryPoint("0.7")

const kernelClient = createKernelAccountClient({
  // other options...

  paymaster: {
    getPaymasterData: (userOperation) => {
      const zerodevPaymaster = createZeroDevPaymasterClient({
        chain,
        // Get this RPC from ZeroDev dashboard
        transport: http(PAYMASTER_RPC),
      })
      return zerodevPaymaster.sponsorUserOperation({
        userOperation,
      })
    }
  }
})
```
