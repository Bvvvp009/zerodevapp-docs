# Paying Gas with ERC20s

:::info
Impatient?  Check out [complete examples here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/tree/main/pay-gas-with-erc20).
:::

:::warning
This feature only works with EntryPoint 0.6 (Kernel v2) for now.
:::

A smart account can pay gas with ERC20 tokens.  As a result, your users don't have to own any native gas tokens (e.g. ETH) in order to use Web3.  Instead, they can just use stablecoins or even your project's own tokens.  When your users pay gas with ERC20 tokens, we add 5% to the exchange rate to make a profit.

:::warning
Using your project's own tokens to pay for gas is a beta feature.  If you are interested, please reach out.
:::

On a high level, you need to do two things to enable a smart account to pay gas in a particular ERC20 token:

- Set up the Kernel client with the ERC20 paymaster.
- Ensure that enough ERC20 tokens have been approved for the ERC20 paymaster.
  - This step is necessary because the ERC20 paymaster needs to withdraw ERC20 tokens from the smart account.

Let's go through these two steps next.  We will be using mainnet USDC in the following examples, but you can use any of [these supported tokens](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/supported-tokens) thanks to our integration with Pimlico.

## Set up Kernel Client

When you [set up an account](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-an-account-client), do this:

```typescript
import {
  createZeroDevPaymasterClient,
  createKernelAccountClient,
  gasTokenAddresses,
} from "@zerodev/sdk"

import { mainnet } from "viem/chains"

import { UserOperation } from "permissionless"

// use whatever chain you want
const chain = mainnet.id
const entryPoint = ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06

const paymasterClient = createZeroDevPaymasterClient({
  chain,
  entryPoint,
  transport: http('ZERODEV_PAYMASTER_RPC'), // get the RPC on ZeroDev dashboard
})

const kernelClient = createKernelAccountClient({
  // other options...

  middleware: {
    sponsorUserOperation: async ({ userOperation }) => {
      return paymasterClient.sponsorUserOperation({
        userOperation,
        entryPoint,
        gasToken: gasTokenAddresses[chain.id]['USDC'],
      })
    },
  },
})
```

## Approve ERC20 tokens for paymaster

Use the `getERC20PaymasterApproveCall` function to construct a call that approves the paymaster with the ERC20 tokens:

```typescript
import { getERC20PaymasterApproveCall } from "@zerodev/sdk"

const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
  userOperation: {
    callData: await kernelClient.account.encodeCallData(
      await getERC20PaymasterApproveCall(paymasterClient, {
        gasToken: gasTokenAddresses[chain.id]['USDC'],
        approveAmount: parseEther('0.1'),
      }),
    ),
  },
})
```

Thanks to [batching](/sdk/core-api/batch-transactions), it's possible to batch the approval with the UserOp you want to send:

```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
  userOperation: {
    callData: await account.encodeCallData([
      // The approval
      await getERC20PaymasterApproveCall(paymasterClient, {
        gasToken: gasTokenAddresses[chain.id]['USDC'],
        approveAmount: parseEther('0.1'),
      }),
      // The actual call
      {
        to: '0x...'
        data: "0x...",
        value: BigInt(0),
      },
    ]),
  },
})
```

Note that you only have to approve once, as long as the approval amount is sufficient for many UserOps.  The [paymaster contract by Pimlico](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/erc20-paymaster/blob/main/src/ERC20PaymasterV06.sol) has been audited, it's widely used and generally considered safe.

## Estimate Gas in ERC20s

If you need to estimate gas in terms of a ERC20 token, do this:

```ts
const userOperation = await kernelClient.prepareUserOperationRequest({
    userOperation: {
        // replace this with your actual calldata
        callData: await account.encodeCallData({
            to: zeroAddress,
            value: BigInt(0),
            data: "0x"
        })
    },
    account: kernelClient.account,
})

const erc20Amount = await paymasterClient.estimateGasInERC20({
    userOperation,

    // replace this with the token you want
    gasTokenAddress: gasTokenAddresses[chain.id]["USDC"]
})
```

You can also see [a code example for estimating gas here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/pay-gas-with-erc20/estimate-gas.ts).

## Supported Tokens

We support [these tokens](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/supported-tokens) thanks to our integration with Pimlico.
