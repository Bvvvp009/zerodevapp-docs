# Creating a Smart Account

At the core of account abstraction is the *smart account* -- an [account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) powered by a smart contract.  The fact that smart accounts are smart contracts is what allows us to *abstract* their logic, from authentication to gas payments and more.

Kernel is a *modular smart account* that can be customized with plugins.  When you create a Kernel account, you need to decide on a [*default validator*](/sdk/plugins/intro), which is a plugin that determines how UserOps are validated by default.

The most popular default validator is the ECDSA validator, which mimics the behavior of normal [EOAs](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#eoa) (the type of accounts that wallets like MetaMask manage).  It validates UserOps and messages by checking if they are signed by a specific ECDSA private key known as the "signer" or "owner."  We will be using ECDSA validator for this tutorial, but you can see [all default validators here](/sdk/plugins/intro).

## Helper API

The easiest way to create a Kernel account is through [**presets**](/sdk/presets/intro) -- helper functions that create Kernel accounts based on common configurations.  For example, to create a ECDSA Kernel account using ZeroDev infra:

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from "@zerodev/presets/zerodev"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains"
import { Hex } from "viem"

// Create a signer
const signer = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex)

// Create a Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
    chain: polygonMumbai,
    projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
    signer,
})
```

For a more flexible API, read on to learn the core API.

## Core API

The core API is for people who want complete control over their Kernel accounts's settings.  Follow the following steps.

### Creating a public client

In Viem, a [public client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public.html) is an interface to a JSON-RPC API such as Infura or Alchemy.  [Most bundlers](/meta-infra/intro) today implement the standard JSON-RPC on top of the bundler RPC, so you can create a public client with your bundler:

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem"

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("BUNDLER_RPC"),  // replace this with bundler URL
})
```

### Creating a signer

As aforementioned, a Kernel account using a ECDSA validator is "owned" by a signer, which is anything that can sign messages with a private key.

Since Kernel is built on top of Viem, we can use any [Viem account](https://viem.sh/docs/accounts/privateKey.html) as the signer.  In this example, we create a signer from a private key:

```typescript
import { Hex } from "viem"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"

const signer = privateKeyToAccount("PRIVATE_KEY" as Hex)
```

Replace `PRIVATE_KEY` with an actual private key.  You can [generate a random one here](https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random).

### Creating a ECDSA validator

Then create a ECDSA validator from the signer:

```typescript
import { signerToEcdsaValidator } from "@zerodev/ecdsa-validator"

const ecdsaValidator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer,
})
```

### Create a Kernel account

Next, create a Kernel account with the ECDSA validator:

```typescript
import { createKernelAccount } from "@zerodev/sdk"

const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    validator: ecdsaValidator,
  },
})
```

### Create an account client

Now that we have an account, we can finally construct an "account client," which is the equivalent of a [wallet client in Viem](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html) that allows you to send UserOps to bundlers.

```typescript
import { createKernelAccountClient } from "@zerodev/sdk"
import { http } from "viem"
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains'

const kernelClient = createKernelAccountClient({
  account,
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  transport: http('BUNDLER_RPC'),
  sponsorUserOperation,  // optional -- only if you want to use a paymaster
})
```

Note that:

- You need to replace the `BUNDLER_RPC` with an [actual bundler RPC](/meta-infra/intro).
- `sponsorUserOperation` only needs to be specified if you want to [use a paymaster](/sdk/core-api/sponsor-gas).

## FAQs

### When I create an account, is it deployed on-chain?

No.  If your account hasn't been deployed yet, we simply use [`CREATE2`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) to compute the address that the account *would* be deployed to.  Your account is deployed automatically with the first UserOp it sends.

In other words, "creating" accounts with the SDK is free -- you can create an infinite number of such account objects without paying any gas.  It's only when you send the first UserOp that the account is deployed automatically.

### Can I create multiple accounts from the same EOA signer?

Yes, you can do so by providing an `index` when you create the account object.

```typescript
import { createKernelAccount } from "@zerodev/sdk"

const account = createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    validator: ecdsaValidator,
  },
  // optionally specify the index; different indexes will yield different accounts
  index: 1,
})
```
