# Plugins Introduction

[Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel) is a *modular smart account*, which means it's a smart account that can be extended with *plugins*.

In Kernel parlance, there are two types of plugins:

- **Validators**: plugins that change how the account validates UserOps.
- **Executors**: plugins that give the account new functions to execute with.

Most commonly, the plugin you need is a validator, since Kernel already natively supports powerful execution functions that cover the majority of use cases.  In the remaining of the docs, when we refer to "plugins" we will be referring to validators.

There are two types of validators:

- **Default validators** determine how UserOps and signatures are validated by default.  Default validators are also known as "sudo validators" because they can enable and disable other validators.  Examples here include ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig.

- **Non-default validators** determine how UserOps are validated under certain conditions.  Examples here include session keys, recovery, and kill switch.

When you create a Kernel account, you create it by specifying a `validator`.  For example:

```typescript
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    validator: ecdsaValidator,
  },
})
```

Or, if the validator is to be used as a non-default validator that needs to be enabled by the default validator, you specify both.  For example:

```typescript
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    defaultValidator: ecdsaValidator,
    validator: sessionKeyValidator,
  },
})
```

If it's not making much sense, don't worry about it.  We are working on dedicated docs for Kernel & plugins.  For now, just use the left sidebar to check out the specific plugins you want to use.
