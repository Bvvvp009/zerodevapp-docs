# Plugins Introduction

[Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel) is a *modular smart account*, which means it's a smart account that can be extended with *plugins* (sometimes also called *modules*).

In Kernel parlance, there are two types of plugins:

- **Validators**: plugins that change how the account validates UserOps.
- **Executors**: plugins that give the account new functions to execute with.

## Validators

There are two types of validators:

- **Sudo validators** determine how UserOps and signatures are validated by default.  **Each account has one and only one sudo validator.**  By default, only sudo validators can enable/disable other validators.  In other words, to add or remove a validator, the sudo validator for your account must *approve*.

- **Regular validators** are validators that are invoked when specific execution functions are called.  For example, you might associate a multisig validator with a `recoverAccount()` function, in which case a multisig would be used when you try to recover the account.

When you create a validator and use it to [construct an account](/sdk/core-api/create-account#create-a-kernel-account), you can set it as either `sudo` or `regular` validator:

```ts
// sudo
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: someValidator,   // [!code focus]
  },
})

// regular
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    regular: someValidator,   // [!code focus]
  },
})
```

### Enabling a regular validator

To enable a regular validator, the sudo validator must approve.  If it's the first time you are using a validator, you must pass the sudo validator when you construct the account object:

```ts
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: sudoValidator,
    regular: regularValidator,
  },
})
```

## Executors

### Building an executor

Executors are smart contracts that define functions for Kernel accounts to execute via [delegatecall](https://solidity-by-example.org/delegatecall/).  When combined with validators, this allows you to use specific validation logic for specific execution functions.

As an example, let's say that you want to set up a multisig that can recover your Kernel account.  And let's say your recovery contract looks like this:

```solidity
contract RecoveryExecutor {
  function recover(address newOwner) public {
    // do some recovery stuff
  }
}
```

**Keep in mind that the smart account will call the executor with `delegatecall`, meaning that the executor will execute in the storage context of the account itself.**  It's therefore crucial that you are fully confident in the executor's logic, as a poorly (or maliciously) implemented executor can brick your account.

You can deploy executors however you want, but we've found [Orchestra](https://github.com/zerodevapp/orchestra) helpful for deploying an executor on multiple networks.

### Using the executor

Once you have deployed an executor, you can use it by setting up the account object like this:

```ts
const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,  // sudo is only needed if enabling the validator
    regular: multisigValidator,
    executorData: {
      executor: recoveryExecutorAddress,
      selector: toFunctionSelector('recover(address newOwner)'),
    },
  }
})
```

In this example, we are saying that, when the `recover(address newOwner)` function is called on this Kernel account, the `multisigValidator` will be used to validate the UserOp.  In other words, a multisig must approve for the recovery to go through.  And we use the ECDSA sudo validator to enable the multisig to perform recovery in the first place.

To actually execute the executor, simple send a UserOp with a `callData` that invokes the executor function:

```ts
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
  userOperation: {
    callData: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: executorABI,
      functionName: 'recover',
      args: [newOwnerAddress],
    })
  },
})
```

See the [recovery documentation](/sdk/plugins/recovery#recovery-plugin) for a complete example of using executors.
