# Weighted ECDSA

The **Weighted ECDSA** plugin allows you to associate multiple signers with your Kernel account, each having a different *weight*.  On a high level, there are two primary use cases:

- Set up your account as a **multisig**.
- Set up one or more **guardians** for your account.  The guardians can be set up with specific "actions" they are allowed to perform, such as:
  - Recovery
  - Pausing (kill switch)
  - Anything you can think of.

## Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator
```

```bash [bun]
bun i @zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator
```

## Creating a weighted ECDSA validator

With Weighted ECDSA, each signer is set up with a **weight**, and for any given signature, there must be enough combined weight to reach or surpass the **threshold** for the signature to be considered valid.

For example, let's say we have:

- Threshold: 100
- Weights:
  - Signer A: 100
  - Signer B: 50
  - Signer C: 50

In this case, we are setting up a multisig where either signer A alone (100 = 100), or signer B and C together (50 + 50 = 100) can provide a valid signature.

To create a validator with the above configuration in code:

```ts
import { createWeightedECDSAValidator } from "@zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator"

const weightedECDSAValidator = await createWeightedECDSAValidator(publicClient, {
  config: {
    threshold: 100,
    signers: [
      { address: signerA.address, weight: 100 },
      { address: signerB.address, weight: 50 },
      { address: signerC.address, weight: 50 },
    ]
  },
  signers: [signerB, signerC],
})
```

## Using Weighted ECDSA as a sudo validator

You can use Weighted ECDSA as the sudo validator, in which case it basically turns your Kernel account into a multisig.

```ts
import { createWeightedECDSAValidator } from "@zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator"
import { createKernelAccount } from "@zerodev/sdk"

const multisigValidator = await createWeightedECDSAValidator(publicClient, {
  config: {
    // your config
  },
  signers: [ /* your signers */ ],
})

const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: multisigValidator,
  }
})
```

Please refer to the [multisig documentation](/sdk/plugins/multisig) for detailed instructions.

## Using Weighted ECDSA as a regular validator

When you use weighted ECDSA as a regular validator, you are effectively setting up a group of guardians that can perform specific functions.  This has many use cases, such as recovery, kill switch, automating transactions for users, etc.

```ts
import { createWeightedECDSAValidator } from "@zerodev/weighted-ecdsa-validator"
import { createKernelAccount } from "@zerodev/sdk"

const guardiansValidator = await createWeightedECDSAValidator(publicClient, {
  config: {
    // your config
  },
  signers: [ /* your signers */ ],
})

const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    regular: guardiansValidator,
  }
})
```

Please refer to the [guardians documentation](/sdk/plugins/guardians) for detailed instructions.
