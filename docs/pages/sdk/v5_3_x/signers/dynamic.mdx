# Use Dynamic with ZeroDev

[Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/) is a platform that offers Web3 login solutions designed for easy integration and user-friendly experiences. It features [passkey embedded wallets](https://www.dynamic.xyz/features/embedded-wallets), crypto-native login, and profile and multi-wallet management. Additionally, the platform provides tools for authorization, orchestration, and more, aiming to streamline wallet-based authentication and identity management. Dynamic is built to cater to both casual users and crypto-savvy individuals, emphasizing non-custodial, passwordless, and flexible login options.

## Set up

To use Dynamic with ZeroDev, you have two options: Dynamic's native integration that utilizes ZeroDev, or a custom integration using Dynamic's Externally Owned Account (EOA) as a signer. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

### Native Integration

Dynamic natively supports account abstraction using ZeroDev. This integration allows you to sponsor gas fees, bundle transactions, recover and transfer accounts, utilize session keys.
- For more information and how to get started, visit the [Dynamic Account Abstraction documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/smart-wallets/smart-wallet-providers/zerodev).

### Custom Integration
If you would like to use ZeroDev directly with a Dynamic project, you can set up a custom integration using Dynamics's EOA as a signer.
- Begin by setting up your application with Dynamic, as detailed in the [Dynamic documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/introduction/welcome).
- Dynamic also offers a quick start guide and sample apps, available [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/quickstart).

## Implementing Custom Integration
Integrating ZeroDev with Dynamic is straightforward once your application is set up. Dynamic provides an EOA wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Get the Dynamic wallet's Provider
To begin, ensure your application is integrated with Dynamic. Detailed guidance is available in the [Dynamic documentation](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/). 

The following example demonstrates the use of Dynamic's React Core SDK. Ensure your React app is already configured with Dynamic; for setup instructions, refer to the [tutorial](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/tutorial).
```typescript
import { useDynamicContext } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";

// Use the `useDynamicContext` hook to get the primary wallet
const { primaryWallet } = useDynamicContext();

// Get the dynamicWalletClient, we will use in the next section
const dynamicWalletClient = await primaryWallet?.connector?.getWalletClient();
```

### Use with ZeroDev

Use the WalletClient from Dynamic to create a smart account signer, which can be passed to a validator. For detailed guidance on using a validator, refer to our documentation on [creating accounts](/sdk/v5_3_x/core-api/create-account#api).

```typescript
import { signerToEcdsaValidator } from "@zerodev/ecdsa-validator"
import { KERNEL_V3_1 } from "@zerodev/sdk/constants"
import { walletClientToSmartAccountSigner, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 } from 'permissionless';
import { createPublicClient } from "viem";
import { polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains';

// Use the WalletClient from Dynamic to create a SmartAccountSigner
const smartAccountSigner = await walletClientToSmartAccountSigner(dynamicWalletClient);

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  // Use your own RPC provider (e.g. Infura/Alchemy).
  transport: http('https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology'),
  chain: polygonAmoy,
})

// Pass your `smartAccountSigner` to the validator
const ecdsaValidator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
  entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
  kernelVersion: KERNEL_V3_1
})

// You can now use this ECDSA Validator to create a Kernel account
```
