# Batching Transactions

Smart accounts like Kernel support *batching* transactions -- rolling multiple transactions into one.  This is very useful for simplifying Web3 interactions for your users.  For instance, instead of doing `approve()` followed by `transfer()`, your user can do both in one transaction.

Batching transactions has a number of important benefits:

- Your user waits for only 1 transaction instead of multiple.
- Your user pays less gas.
- If any transaction in the batch reverts, the entire batch reverts. This ensures that your user won't be stuck in an inconsistent state.
  - This is known as "atomicity."

## API

There are two ways to send batched transactions.  `sendTransactions` is a simple API that's good enough for most use cases.  If you need fine-grained control over your UserOp, you can use `sendUserOperation`.

### `sendTransactions`

```typescript
const txHash = await kernelClient.sendTransactions({
  transactions: [
    {
      to: "0xADDRESS",
      value: value,
      data: "0xDATA",
    },
    {
      to: "0xADDRESS",
      value: value,
      data: "0xDATA",
    },
  ],
})
```

### `sendUserOperation`

You can learn more about the `sendUserOperation` API [here](/sdk/v5_3_x/core-api/send-transactions#sending-raw-userops).

To send a UserOp with batching, simply pass an array of calls into `encodeCallData`.

```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
    userOperation: {
        callData: account.encodeCallData([
          {
            to,
            value,
            data,
          },
          {
            to,
            value,
            data,
          },
        ]),
        // other UserOp params
    },
})
```
