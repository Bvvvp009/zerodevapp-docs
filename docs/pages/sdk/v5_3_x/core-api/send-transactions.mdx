# Sending Transactions

:::info
Impatient?  Check out [complete examples here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/tree/main/send-transactions).
:::

In ERC-4337, a transaction is known as a "UserOp."  A UserOp looks mostly like a regular transaction, but it contains some extra information specific to AA, such as whether the UserOp should be sponsored.

There are two ways to send UserOps:

- Sending raw UserOps
- Sending regular transactions through the Viem API, which ZeroDev then "translates" into UserOps

The former enables the highest degree of flexibility, whereas the latter is more interoperable with existing libraries like Viem that deal only with transactions and not UserOps.

We will now describe both approaches.  We assume that you have already [created a Kernel account](/sdk/v5_3_x/core-api/create-account).

## Using the Viem API

Since the Kernel account client implements [Viem's wallet client interface](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html), you can send UserOps with standard Viem methods.

### Sending Transactions

```typescript
const txnHash = await kernelClient.sendTransaction({
  to: "TO_ADDRESS",
  value: VALUE,  // default to 0
  data: "0xDATA",  // default to 0x
})
```

This function returns the transaction hash of the ERC-4337 bundle that contains the UserOp.  Due to the way that ERC-4337 works, by the time we get the transaction hash, the ERC-4337 bundle (and therefore the UserOps includeded within) will have already been mined, meaning that you don't have to [wait with the hash](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/waitForTransactionReceipt.html).

If you need to separate the sending from the waiting of the UserOp, try [sending raw UserOps](#sending-raw-userops).

### Interacting with Contracts

First, construct a [Viem contract instance](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html) by passing the Kernel account client as the `walletClient`:

```typescript
import { getContract } from 'viem'

const contract = getContract({
  address: '0xADDRESS',
  abi: abi,
  publicClient: publicClient,
  walletClient: kernelClient,
})
```

Then, interact with the contract like how you normally would:

```typescript
// Example code from Viem

const balance = await contract.read.balanceOf([
  '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC',
])
const hash = await contract.write.mint([69420])
const logs = await contract.getEvents.Transfer()
const unwatch = contract.watchEvent.Transfer(
  {
    from: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045',
    to: '0xa5cc3c03994db5b0d9a5eedd10cabab0813678ac'
  },
  { onLogs: logs => console.log(logs) }
)
```

## Sending UserOps

### UserOp API

Sending raw UserOps affords you with the highest degree of control.  To send a raw UserOp, use `sendUserOperation`:

```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
    userOperation: {
        callData: "0x..."
    },
})
```

While `callData` is the only required field, there are many other fields that you can read about on the [ERC-4337 spec](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/erc/ERCS/erc-4337.md):

```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
    userOperation: {
        sender: "0x0C123D90Da0a640fFE54a2359D159629065775C5",
        nonce: 3n,
        initCode: "0x",
        callData: "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",
        callGasLimit: 50305n,
        verificationGasLimit: 80565n,
        preVerificationGas: 56135n,
        maxFeePerGas: 113000000n,
        maxPriorityFeePerGas: 113000100n,
        paymasterAndData: "0xe93eca6595fe94091dc1af46aac2a8b5d79907700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065133b6f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005d3d07ae8973ba1b8a26d0d72d8882dfa97622942a63c4b655f4928385ce587f6aa2fa1ab347e615d5f39e1214d18f426375da8a01514fb126eb0bb29f0c319d1b",
        signature: "0xf1513a8537a079a4d728bb87099b2c901e2c9034e60c95a4d41ac1ed75d6ee90270d52b48af30aa036e9a205ea008e1c62b317e7b3f88b3f302d45fb1ba76a191b"
    },
})
```

Other than `callData`, every field has a sensible default:

- `sender` defaults to the Kernel account address
- `nonce` defaults to the next available nonce
- `initCode` defaults to `0x` if the account has been deployed, or the correct `initCode` if not.
- `callGasLimit`, `verificationGasLimit`, and `preVerificationGas` default to estimations provided by the underlying bundler and paymaster.
- `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` default to estimations provided by the public client.
- `paymasterAndData` defaults to `0x` if no paymaster was specified when you created the Kernel account object, or it will use the value provided by the paymaster.
- `signature` defaults to the signature provided by the signer.

### Encoding callData

To encode the calldata, use the `encodeCallData` function from the account object:

```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
    userOperation: {
        callData: kernelClient.account.encodeCallData({
          to,
          value,
          data,
        }),
    },
})
```

You can use Viem's helper functions such as `encodeFunctionData` to encode function calls.  For example:

```ts
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
  userOperation: {
    callData: await kernelClient.account.encodeCallData({
      to: contractAddress,
      value: BigInt(0),
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: contractABI,
        functionName: "functionName",
        args: [args1, args2],
      }),
    }),
  },
})
```

### Waiting for a UserOp to complete

To wait for a UserOp to complete, call `waitForUserOperationReceipt` using a bundler client:

```typescript
const receipt = await bundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
  hash: userOpHash,
})
```

Note that if you had constructed your `kernelClient` with a [preset](/sdk/v5_3_x/presets/intro), you may not have access to a bundler client.  Instead, you can extend your `kernelClient` with bundler actions:

```typescript
import { ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07, bundlerActions } from "permissionless"

const bundlerClient = kernelClient.extend(bundlerActions(ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07))
const receipt = await bundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
  hash: userOpHash,
})
```

### Constructing a UserOp for sending later

In some applications, you might want to construct a UserOp but not immediately send it.  There are two possible flows:

- If you want to separate signing and sending:
  - Create and sign a UserOp with `kernelClient.signUserOperation()`
  - Send the UserOp with `bundlerClient.sendUserOperation()`

- If you want to separate the constructing, signing, and sending:
  - Create an unsigned UserOp with `kernelClient.prepareUserOperationRequest()`
  - Sign the UserOp with `kernelClient.account.signUserOperation()` and manually set the `userOp.signature` field
  - Send the UserOp with `bundlerClient.sendUserOperation()`
