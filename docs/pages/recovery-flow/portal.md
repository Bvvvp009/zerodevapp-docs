# Recovery Portal

The recovery portal is a hosted UI where Kernel account owners can recover their accounts, if they have set up recovery.

Note that the recovery portal is just a convenience UI -- it's not essential for executing recovery.  That is, even if the portal goes down or ceases to exist, a guardian can always interact with the smart account directly to complete recovery.
