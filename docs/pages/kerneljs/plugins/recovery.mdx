# Recovery

One of the biggest challenges with Web3 UX is securing your account.  With a traditional EOA wallet, you must either take great care to safely backup your seed phrase in case you ever lose it, or trust a centralized key infrastructure to manage your key for you. 

With Kernel, it's possible to set up "**guardians**" for your account.  Guardians are entities that are authorized to update the signer of your account.  In other words, if you lose your key, you can generate a new key and ask your guardians to set it as the new signer for your account, thus *recovering* the account.

There are two typical use cases for recovery:

- **Self-recovery**: your user can set up recovery for their account with another auth factor they own, such as a passkey or another wallet they own.

- **DApp-assisted recovery**: your user might set you (the DApp) as their guardian.  When they lose their account, they would contact you and you would recover the account for them.

There are two ways to use recovery: through a pre-built recovery flow or build a totally custom flow using the Kernel recovery plugin.

## Pre-built Recovery Flow

[Check out the recovery flow docs.](/recovery-flow/intro)

## Recovery Plugin

The recovery plugin is currently being ported to Kernel.js from the old ZeroDev SDK.  You can find [recovery docs for the old SDK here](https://docs-v4.zerodev.app/use-wallets/recovery).
