# Use Arcana Auth with kernel.js

[Arcana Auth](https://www.arcana.network/) offers a self-custodial Web3 wallet embedded within applications, utilizing asynchronous distributed key generation algorithms for enhanced security and privacy. This wallet, accessible without the need for a browser extension, allows authenticated users to instantly access and sign blockchain transactions within the app environment.

## Set up

To use Arcana Auth with kernel.js, first create an application that integrates with Arcana Auth.

- Refer to the [Arcana Auth documentation site](https://docs.arcana.network/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Arcana Auth.
- For a quick start, Arcana Auth provides a web app guide, available [here](https://docs.arcana.network/quick-start/web/).

## Integration
Integrating kernel.js with Arcana Auth is straightforward after setting up the project. Arcana Auth provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the authProvider object
After following the Arcana Auth documentation, you will have access to a `authProvider` object as shown below:

```typescript
import {
  AuthProvider,
  type ConstructorParams,
} from "@arcana/auth";

// Param options here will be specific to your project.  See the Arcana Auth docs for more info.
const params: ConstructorParams = {};
const authProvider = new AuthProvider(clientId, params);
```

### Use with kernel.js

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@kerneljs/presets/zerodev';
import { providerToSmartAccountSigner } from '@kerneljs/core'
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains';

// Convert the authProvider to a SmartAccountSigner
const smartAccountSigner = providerToSmartAccountSigner(authProvider.provider);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```
