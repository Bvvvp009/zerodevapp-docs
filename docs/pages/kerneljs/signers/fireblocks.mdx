# Use Fireblocks with kernel.js

[Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/) is a user-friendly platform designed for building blockchain-based products and managing digital asset operations. It uses a direct custody approach, combining high performance with zero counterparty risk and multi-layered security. The platform includes secure MPC-based digital asset wallets, a policy engine for governance and transaction rules, and comprehensive treasury management. Fireblocks' security framework features multiple layers, including MPC-CMP technology, secure enclaves, and a robust policy engine, ensuring protection against cyberattacks, internal threats, and human errors. It's widely used for various operations like treasury, trading, and managing NFTs, smart contracts, and user wallets.

## Set up

To use Fireblocks with kernel.js, first create an application that integrates with Fireblocks.

- Refer to the [Fireblocks documentation site](https://developers.fireblocks.com/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Fireblocks.
- For a quick start, Fireblocks provides a guide, available [here](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/quickstart).

## Integration
Integrating kernel.js with Fireblocks is straightforward after setting up the project. Fireblocks provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the Fireblocks object
After following the Fireblocks documentation, you will have access to a `FireblocksWeb3Provider` object as shown below:

```typescript
import { FireblocksWeb3Provider, type FireblocksProviderConfig } from "@fireblocks/fireblocks-web3-provider";

// Config options here will be specific to your project.  See the Fireblocks docs for more info.
const fireblocksProviderConfig: FireblocksProviderConfig = { ... };
const fireblocksWeb3Provider = new FireblocksWeb3Provider(fireblocksProviderConfig);
```

### Use with kernel.js

```typescript
import { createEcdsaKernelAccountClient } from '@kerneljs/presets/zerodev';
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains';
// TODO import providerToSmartAccountSigner helper function

// Convert the FireblocksWeb3Provider to a SmartAccountSigner
const smartAccountSigner = providerToSmartAccountSigner(fireblocksWeb3Provider);

// Set up your Kernel client
const kernelClient = await createEcdsaKernelAccountClient({
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  projectId: process.env.ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID,
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
});

const kernelAddress = kernelClient.account.address;
```
