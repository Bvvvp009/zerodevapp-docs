# ZeroDev Introduction

**ZeroDev** is an SDK for developing [account abstraction](https://www.erc4337.io) wallets and DApps using [Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel), a smart contract account (or "smart account" for short) that is:

- **Modular**: Kernel accounts can be customized with Solidity plugins.  Features such as multisig, recovery, and session keys are all implemented as plugins.
- **Optimized**: Kernel is [heavily optimized](https://github.com/zerodevapp/aa-benchmark) -- it saves gas for you and your users.
- **Widely used**: Kernel is [the most widely deployed](https://www.bundlebear.com/factories/all) ERC-4337 smart account.

## Why ZeroDev

ZeroDev is the most powerful and flexible account abstraction SDK.

- **Powerful**: ZeroDev supports all major AA features such as sponsoring gas and batching transactions, but it also supports powerful plugins such as session keys, recovery, passkeys, and more.

- **Flexible**: ZeroDev is built on top of [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [Permissionless](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference), which means:
  - You can interact with smart accounts through standard Viem APIs.
  - You can use ZeroDev with any AA infra providers.


## ZeroDev Components

There are four major components of ZeroDev.

- [Core API](/sdk/core-api/intro): the main things you want to do with a smart account, such as sponsoring gas, batching UserOps, etc.

- [Plugins](/sdk/plugins/intro): Kernel plugins that change the validation logic of the account, including passkeys, session keys, recovery, etc.

- [Signers](/sdk/signers/intro): integrations with popular WaaS services such as Privy and Dynamic, allowing you to use these services while using AA.

- [Presets](/sdk/presets/intro): integrations with popular infra providers such as Pimlico, StackUp, Alchemy, and of course ZeroDev itself.
