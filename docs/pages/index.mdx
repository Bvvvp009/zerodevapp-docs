# ZeroDev Introduction

ZeroDev is a **smart, white-labeled, and modular embedded wallet** for building user-friendly Web3 experiences, particularly for DeFi applications.

- **Smart**: ZeroDev leverages account abstraction.
- **White-labeled**: ZeroDev doesn't have a UI -- it provides the underlying wallet logic that you can build a totally customized experience on top of.
- **Modular**: ZeroDev is built on top of [Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel), the most popular open-source smart account that supports ERC-7579 plugins for customizing wallet logic.

ZeroDev is one of the most trusted solutions in AA, powering more than 50% of all AA wallets and a majority of DeFi volume that leverages AA.

## Why Account Abstraction

Simply put, account abstraction is how you build a Web3 experience that feels like Web2, without compromising on security for your users.  With AA, you can:

- **Create self-custody wallets** for your users that support **Web2 logins** (socials, email, passkeys, etc.), so they don’t need to worry about seed phrases.

- **Sponsor gas** for your users so they don’t need to worry about gas, or let them **pay gas in ERC20 tokens** like USDC or even your own project tokens.

- Simplify user flow by **batching transactions**, **removing signing prompts**, and even **automating transactions** for users while they are offline (think subscriptions).

- **Recover wallets** for users if they lose their keys.

And these are just some examples!  ZeroDev is **fully programmable** and can support additional features via plugins.

## Why ZeroDev

- **Powerful**: ZeroDev supports all major AA features such as sponsoring gas and batching transactions, as well as powerful plugins such as session keys, recovery, passkeys, and more.

- **Modular**: ZeroDev is the first AA SDK that natively supports plugins.  You can customize your wallet logic by developing custom plugins.

- **Interoperable**: ZeroDev is built on top of [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [Permissionless](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference), which means:
  - You can interact with smart accounts through standard Viem APIs.
  - You can use ZeroDev with any AA infra providers, avoiding vendor lock-in.
