# ZeroDev Introduction

ZeroDev is the most powerful smart account development platform.  We support:

- Key abstraction
    - Login with passkeys or social accounts.
    - Recover user accounts if they lose their login.

- Gas abstraction
    - Sponsor gas for users, or let them pay gas with ERC20 tokens.

- Transaction abstraction
    - Batch multiple transactions into one.  No more tedious approvals.
    - Automate transactions with session keys.  Great for AI agents.

- [Chain abstraction](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/advanced/chain-abstraction)
    - Spend tokens on any chain, without bridging.

ZeroDev can be used as a standalone embedded smart account, or used alongside WaaS solutions such as [Privy](/sdk/signers/privy) and [Dynamic](/sdk/signers/dynamic).

ZeroDev is the most trusted solution in AA, powering more than 4 million smart accounts on 30+ networks for 100+ teams.
