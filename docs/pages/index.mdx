# ZeroDev Introduction

**ZeroDev** is an SDK for developing account abstraction (AA) wallets and DApps using [Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel), a smart contract account (or "smart account" for short) that is:

- **Modular**: Kernel accounts can be customized with Solidity plugins.  Features such as multisig, recovery, and session keys are all implemented as plugins.
- **Optimized**: Kernel is [heavily optimized](https://github.com/zerodevapp/aa-benchmark) -- it saves gas for you and your users.
- **Widely used**: Kernel is [the most widely deployed](https://www.bundlebear.com/factories/all) ERC-4337 smart account.

## Why Account Abstraction

Simply put, account abstraction is how you build a Web3 experience that feels like Web2, without compromising on security for your users.  With AA, you can:

- **Create self-custody wallets** for your users that support **Web2 logins** (socials, email, passkeys, etc.), so they don’t need to worry about seed phrases.

- **Sponsor gas** for your users so they don’t need to worry about gas, or let them **pay gas in ERC20 tokens** like USDC or even your own project tokens.

- Simplify user flow by **batching related transactions**, **removing repetitive signing prompts**, and even **automate transactions** for them while they are offline (think subscriptions).

- **Recover wallets** for users if they lose their login credentials.

And these are just some examples!  ZeroDev is **fully programmable** and can support additional features via plugins.

## Why ZeroDev

- **Powerful**: ZeroDev supports all major AA features such as sponsoring gas and batching transactions, as well as powerful plugins such as session keys, recovery, passkeys, and more.

- **Modular**: ZeroDev is the first AA SDK that natively supports plugins.  You can customize your wallet logic by developing custom plugins.

- **Interoperable**: ZeroDev is built on top of [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [Permissionless](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference), which means:
  - You can interact with smart accounts through standard Viem APIs.
  - You can use ZeroDev with any AA infra providers, avoiding vendor lock-in.

## SDK Components

There are four major components of the ZeroDev SDK.

- [Core API](/sdk/core-api/create-account): the main things you want to do with a smart account, such as sponsoring gas, batching UserOps, etc.

- [Plugins](/sdk/plugins/intro): Kernel plugins that change the validation logic of the account, including passkeys, session keys, recovery, etc.

- [Signers](/sdk/signers/intro): integrations with popular WaaS services such as Privy and Dynamic, allowing you to use these services with account abstraction.

- [Presets](/sdk/presets/intro): helper functions for integrating with popular infra providers such as Pimlico, StackUp, Alchemy, and of course ZeroDev itself.
