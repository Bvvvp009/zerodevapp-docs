# ZeroDev Introduction

**ZeroDev** is a smart embedded wallet for DeFi applications.  It leverages cutting-edge account abstraction (AA) technologies to remove the three main pain points with Web3 experiences today:

- Key management: ZeroDev simplifies key management through on-chain passkeys (EIP-7212) and social logins.  With on-chain recovery, your users never have 
- Gas: ZeroDev lets your users pay gas in any ERC20 tokens, or have their gas sponsored entirely.

It solves the following problems for DeFi apps:

- Key management: your users can manage their accounts with passkeys and social logins.

- Gas management: your users can pay gas in any ERC20 tokens, or you can sponsor gas for your users.  In either case, they won't have to buy native tokens before using your app.

- Transaction management: your users can *securely* interact with your DApp without dealing with signing prompts, aka the "1-click trading" experience.  This is possible because of our session keys technology that is secured via smart contracts.

- Transaction automation: your users can delegate specific transactions for you to execute on their behalf, even when they are offline.

- Transaction batching: for complex protocol interactions, you can batch them into one single transaction, saving time and gas for your users.
