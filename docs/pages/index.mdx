# ZeroDev Smart Wallet

ZeroDev is a **smart, white-labeled, embedded wallet** for building user-friendly Web3 experiences, particularly for DeFi applications.

- By "smart," we refer to the fact that we use account abstraction (AA).
- By "white-labeled," we refer to the fact that we don't have a UI -- we are the underlying wallet logic that you can build a totally customized experience on top of.

ZeroDev is one of the most trusted solutions in AA, powering more than 50% of all AA wallets and a majority of DeFi volume that leverages AA.

## How ZeroDev improves UX

Web3 UX can be roughly divided into three areas: **keys, gas, and transactions**.

### Keys

Traditionally, keys are represented as 12-word seed phrases that users are expected to diligently record and secure.  This is very poor UX and where the majority of users fall off.

With ZeroDev, you can support not just traditional wallets like MetaMask, but also **social signins** and **passkeys**, including a flexible multisig system.

Furthermore, ZeroDev supports account recovery, so your users can recover their accounts even if they lose their login credentials.

### Gas

Gas is a huge barrier to onboarding.  If your users do not happen to have the native gas token (e.g. ETH) in their wallet, they cannot transact on your app.

With ZeroDev, gas can be sponsored, or paid in any ERC20 tokens.

### Transactions

Web3 transactions typically work like this:

- The user initiates every transactions.
- The user confirms every transaction.
- Every transaction can do anything (which means a single bad transaction can steal your tokens).
- Every transaction does one thing.
- You must wait for a previous transaction to complete before any future transactions can complete.

With ZeroDev, transactions gain superpowers:

- You can send transactions for your users.
- The user does not need to confirm every transaction.
- Transactions can be scoped with "permissions."
- Transactions can be batched.
- Transactions can be processed in parallel.

## How ZeroDev fits into the wallet stack

ZeroDev can be used as a full-stack embedded wallet solution, or it can be used alongside a traditional embedded wallet such as Privy and Dynamic to provide AA functionalities.

## Next Steps

There are two ways to use ZeroDev:

- If you are building a React-based application, we recommend using the `@zerodev/waas` package.  [Click here to get started](/smart-wallet/quickstart-react).

- If you are building a non-React app or if you prefer lower-level control, use the core SDK `@zerodev/sdk`.  [Click here to get started](/smart-wallet/quickstart-core).
