# ZeroDev Introduction

**ZeroDev** is a modular SDK for developing DApps and wallets using smart accounts (account abstraction).

ZeroDev is modular in three ways:

- [**Modular smart accounts**](/sdk/permissions/intro) -- you can configure the smart account with plugins to enable features like multisig, session keys, account recovery, etc.

- [**Modular signers**](/sdk/signers/intro) -- your users can manage keys with a variety of methods ranging from passkeys to third-party WaaS such as Privy, Dynamic, Magic, etc.

- [**Modular infra**](/sdk/infra/intro) -- you can use any account abstraction infra provider such as Pimlico, StackUp, Alchemy, etc.

ZeroDev is built on top of [Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel), an open-source and audited smart account that is:

- **Developer-friendly**: Kernel accounts can be customized with [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) plugins.
- **Optimized**: Kernel is [heavily optimized](https://github.com/zerodevapp/aa-benchmark) -- it saves gas for you and your users.
- **Widely used**: Kernel is [the most widely deployed](https://www.bundlebear.com/factories/all) ERC-4337 smart account.

## Why Account Abstraction

Simply put, account abstraction is how you build a Web3 experience that feels like Web2, without compromising on security for your users.  With AA, you can:

- **Create self-custody wallets** for your users that support **Web2 logins** (socials, email, passkeys, etc.), so they don’t need to worry about seed phrases.

- **Sponsor gas** for your users so they don’t need to worry about gas, or let them **pay gas in ERC20 tokens** like USDC or even your own project tokens.

- Simplify user flow by **batching transactions**, **removing signing prompts**, and even **automating transactions** for users while they are offline (think subscriptions).

- **Recover wallets** for users if they lose their keys.

And these are just some examples!  ZeroDev is **fully programmable** and can support additional features via plugins.

## Why ZeroDev

- **Powerful**: ZeroDev supports all major AA features such as sponsoring gas and batching transactions, as well as powerful plugins such as session keys, recovery, passkeys, and more.

- **Modular**: ZeroDev is the first AA SDK that natively supports plugins.  You can customize your wallet logic by developing custom plugins.

- **Interoperable**: ZeroDev is built on top of [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [Permissionless](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference), which means:
  - You can interact with smart accounts through standard Viem APIs.
  - You can use ZeroDev with any AA infra providers, avoiding vendor lock-in.
