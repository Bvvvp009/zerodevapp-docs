ZeroDev offers two modes for setting up social login: Development and Production. Follow the steps below to configure your social login in our [dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/auth-options).

- **Development Mode**:
  - Available to all users by default.
  - Functions only when your application is running locally on the `localhost` URI.
  - Ideal for testing social sign-in features during development.

- **Production Mode**:
  - Available to users on the "Growth" plan or higher.
  - To activate, complete the form in the [Social Auth](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/auth-options) section of the ZeroDev dashboard.
  - Submit the form for review; reviews are typically completed within 24 hours.
  - Ensure all sections of the form are completed accurately to facilitate a successful review.
  - ZeroDev uses [Magic](https://magic.link/docs/home/security/product-security) for its social integration. Links to Magic's documentation are provided in the form to assist with setup (e.g., Google Developer Console).

**Production Mode Configuration Steps**:
1. Enter the client ID and client secret from your social provider into the designated fields in the ZeroDev dashboard.
2. Copy the redirect URI provided by ZeroDev into your social providerâ€™s dashboard.
3. Ensure that the redirect URI and whitelist URI for your application are input correctly in the form.
4. Submit the form for review.

For detailed information on how Magic handles the creation of public/private key pairs, integral to the security of the social login process, please refer to [Magic's product security documentation.](https://magic.link/docs/home/security/product-security)
