# Signing into Magic Account with Third-party Signers

Magic Account can be used with third-party signers such as [Privy](https://docs.privy.io/), [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/), [Magic](https://magic.link/), and more.

We are still working on the integration docs, but for now, the easiest way to get started with a third-party signer is to [set it up with the ZeroDev SDK](/sdk/signers/intro), then [use chain abstraction with the ZeroDev SDK directly](/sdk/advanced/chain-abstraction).
