# Setup

There are two ways to use ZeroDev:

- Through `@zerodev/waas` which is a high-level React SDK.  If you are building a React app, we recommend using this.

- Through `@zerodev/sdk` which is a low-level TypeScript SDK.  This SDK gives you the most fine-grained control.

Note that you can always "drop down" to the SDK from WaaS.

## Setup

We recommend cloning the following starter templates as you follow along the tutorials.
