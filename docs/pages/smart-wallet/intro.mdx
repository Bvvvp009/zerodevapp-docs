# ZeroDev Smart Wallet

ZeroDev is a **smart embedded wallet** for building user-friendly Web3 experiences, particularly for DeFi applications.

By "smart," we refer to the fact that we use account abstraction (AA), including ERC-4337 for smart contract accounts (aka "smart accounts") and EIP-3074 for EOAs.

## How ZeroDev improves UX

Web3 UX can be roughly divided into three areas: keys, transactions, and gas.

### Keys

Traditionally, keys are represented as 12-word seed phrases that users are expected to diligently record and secure.  This is very poor UX and where the majority of users fall off.

With ZeroDev, you can support not just traditional wallets like MetaMask, but also **social signins** and **passkeys**, including a flexible multisig system.

Furthermore, ZeroDev supports account recovery, so your users can recover their accounts even if they lose their login credentials.

### Transactions

Web3 transactions typically work like this:

- The user initiates every transactions.
- The user confirms every transaction.
- Every transaction can do anything (which means a single bad transaction can steal your tokens).
- Every transaction does one thing.
- You must wait for a previous transaction to complete before any future transactions can complete.

With ZeroDev, all these assumptions are no longer true:

- You can send transactions for your users.
- The user does not need to confirm every transaction.
- Transactions can be scoped with "permissions."
- Transactions can be batched.
- Transactions can be processed in parallel.

### Gas

Gas is a huge barrier to onboarding.  If your users do not happen to have the native gas token (e.g. ETH) in their wallet, they cannot transact on your app.

With ZeroDev, gas can be sponsored, or paid in any ERC20 tokens.

## How ZeroDev fits into the wallet stack

ZeroDev can be used as a full-stack embedded wallet solution, or it can be used alongside a traditional (non-AA) embedded wallet to provide AA functionalities.
