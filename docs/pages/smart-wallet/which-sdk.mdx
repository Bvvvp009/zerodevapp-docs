# Which SDK should I use?

ZeroDev currently offers three SDKs for different use cases:

- `@zerodev/wallet` packages the ZeroDev smart wallet into [Wagmi connectors](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/connectors) and [EIP-1193 providers](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193), so you can easily plug ZeroDev into any application as an embedded wallet.

- `@zerodev/core` implements the core logic of the ZeroDev smart embedded wallet (powered by [Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel)).  This library has the most complete functionality and offers the most low-level and fine-grained control.

- `@zerodev/waas` is a React SDK built on top of `@zerodev/core`.  It can be viewed as the equivalent of Wagmi but for smart wallets.

To decide which SDK to use, first decide what you are building:

## Are you building a wallet or a DApp?

The line between a wallet and a DApp can be a bit blurry in Web3.  For the purpose of this discussion, we define wallets and DApps as follows:

- Wallets: you want your users to use your app as their primary wallet, as opposed to bringing wallets to your app.

- DApps: you want your users to bring wallets to your app, or spin up a wallet for them if they don't have one.

## If you are building a DApp

If you are building a DApp, we recommend that you use `@zerodev/wallet` to spin up a smart embedded wallet for users who don't bring their own smart wallet (which are most users today).

Then, you can program your DApp with Viem/Wagmi as usual, while using smart wallet features (e.g. gas sponsoring) through [the capabilities API](/smart-wallet/quickstart-capabilities).

## If you are building a wallet

[Use `@zerodev/core`](/smart-wallet/quickstart-core) if you want all the ZeroDev features and the most fine-grained control.

[Use `@zerodev/waas`](/smart-wallet/quickstart-react) if you are building the wallet using React.
