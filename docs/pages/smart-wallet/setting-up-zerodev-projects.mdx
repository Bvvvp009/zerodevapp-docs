# Setting up a ZeroDev Project

ZeroDev provides the necessary [infrastructure](/meta-infra/intro) to power your smart accounts.  To start using ZeroDev, you need to create a *project*.

## Creating a Project

Sign up at the [ZeroDev dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/), then create a project for your target network.

</p>

You will then see your "Project Home" with a number of configs.

</p>

These configs give you access to ZeroDev infra.  When you [create wallets](/smart-wallet/creating-wallets), you will be using these values with the SDK.

## Setting up Billing

You can use ZeroDev for free on testnets.

If you want to use ZeroDev on a mainnet, you must sign up for a billing plan.  You can [see the billing plans here](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/billing).
