# Connecting Wallet with Other DApps

If you want your users to be able to use your embedded wallet on other DApps, you can use our WalletConnect integration.

## React SDK `@zerodev/waas`

## Core SDK `@zerodev/walletconnect`

If you are not using our React SDK, you can use the `@zerodev/walletconnect` Core SDK to integrate WalletConnect functionality with your DApp. This SDK provides a comprehensive interface for integrating WalletConnect functionality with a kernel provider, allowing for session management, request handling, and interaction with blockchain networks.
