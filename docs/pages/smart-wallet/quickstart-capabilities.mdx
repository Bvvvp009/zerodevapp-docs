# Quickstart -- Capabilities

Capabilities ([ERC-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792)) is the [new standard way for DApps to interact with smart wallets](/blog/hello-capabilities).  On a high level, it comes down to two steps:

- The DApp *discovers* capabilities of the connected wallet through the `wallet_getCapabilities` RPC.
- The DApp *uses* capabilities through the `wallet_sendCalls` RPC.

By standardizing smart wallet features such as gas sponsorship, transaction batching, and permissions (session keys), capabilities enable DApps to interact with any smart wallets through standard APIs.  This means that:

- If you are building a DApp, you can write your code once and it will work with any AA wallets, whether it's embedded wallets like ZeroDev or standalone wallets like Coinbase Smart Wallet.

- If you are building a wallet, you can write your code once and it will work with any AA accounts, whether it's ZeroDev (Kernel) or another smart account.

**TLDR: capabilities standardize smart wallet features and thereby improve interoperability between smart wallets, reducing vendor lock-in for developers.**

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up a ZeroDev embedded wallet in your DApp, and communicate with it through the standard capability API using Viem/Wagmi.

## Code Example

Use [this example repo](/todo) as a reference as you go through this tutorial.

## Create an embedded Passkey Wallet

ZeroDev has created a number of Wagmi connectors that speak the capabilities API.  In this tutorial, we will use the [passkey](/sdk/advanced/passkeys) connector.  You can find [other connectors here](/smart-wallet/creating-wallets).

Create a Wagmi project with Next.js:

```ts
```

## Send sponsored & batched transactions

Now let's try using two capabilities together: gas sponsorship and batching.  We will send a batch of two transactions, and sponsor gas for them:

```ts
```

## Next Steps

Congrats -- you just sent your first gasless transaction with ZeroDev, through the standard capability API!

In this example, you used a public ZeroDev API key.  Now learn how to [set up your own ZeroDev project](/smart-wallet/setting-up-zerodev-projects).  Then browse the ZeroDev features using the sidebar and see what you'd like to use!
