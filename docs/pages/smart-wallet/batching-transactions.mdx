# Batching

Smart accounts support *batching* transactions -- rolling multiple transactions into one.  This is very useful for simplifying Web3 interactions for your users.  For instance, instead of doing `approve()` followed by `transfer()`, your user can do both in one transaction.

Batching transactions has a number of important benefits:

- Your user waits for only 1 transaction instead of multiple.
- Your user pays less gas.
- If any transaction in the batch reverts, the entire batch reverts. This ensures that your user won't be stuck in an inconsistent state.
  - This is known as "atomicity."

## Capabilities API

Thanks to [the new capabilities standard](/smart-wallet/quickstart-capabilities), you can batch transactions in a standard way regardless of the smart wallet implementation.

To batch transactions, simply use the `wallet_sendCalls` API.  We will be using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendCalls) here but you can find the same API in [Viem](https://viem.sh/experimental/eip5792/sendCalls):

## React API

Simply pass an array of transactions (UserOps) when using the `useSendUserOperation` hook:

```tsx
import { useSendUserOperation, useKernelClient } from '@zerodev/waas'
import { parseAbi } from 'viem'
 
function App() {
  const { write } = useSendUserOperation()
  const { address } = useKernelClient()
  const abi = parseAbi(['function mint(address _to) public'])
 
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        write([
          {
            // first txn
          },
          {
            // second txn
          },
        ])
      }
    >
      Send UserOp
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Core API

There are two ways to send batched transactions.  `sendTransaction` is a simple API that's good enough for most use cases.  If you need fine-grained control over your UserOp, you can use `sendUserOperation`.

### `sendTransaction`

```typescript
const txHash = await kernelClient.sendTransaction({
  calls: [
    {
      to: "0xADDRESS",
      value: value,
      data: "0xDATA",
    },
    {
      to: "0xADDRESS",
      value: value,
      data: "0xDATA",
    },
  ],
})
```

### `sendUserOperation`

You can learn more about the `sendUserOperation` API [here](/sdk/core-api/send-transactions#sending-raw-userops).

To send a UserOp with batching, simply pass an array of calls into `encodeCallData`.

```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
      callData: account.encodeCalls([
        {
          to,
          value,
          data,
        },
        {
          to,
          value,
          data,
        },
      ]),
      // other UserOp params
})
```
