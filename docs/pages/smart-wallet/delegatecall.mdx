# Delegatecall

:::warning
`delegatecall` is very dangerous.  Unless you know exactly what you are doing, don't do it, or you might risk losing all your funds.
:::

`delegatecall` is a powerful EVM opcode that allows the calling contract to execute code in another contract, while keeping the storage context.  [You can read more about `delegatecall` here](https://solidity-by-example.org/delegatecall/).

## Core API

:::info
Check out [a complete example here](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/delegatecall/main.ts).
:::


To send a UserOp that uses `delegatecall`, simply specify the `callType` of the UserOp:


```typescript
const userOpHash = await kernelClient.sendUserOperation({
  userOperation: {
    callData: await kernelClient.account.encodeCallData({
      to: targetAdress,
      data: callData,
      value: 0n,
      callType: "delegatecall",
    }),
  },
})
```
