# Creating wallets

ZeroDev supports three types of wallet creation:

- Passkeys
  - ZeroDev supports on-chain passkeys, where transactions are signed directly with passkeys on your user's device, and the signatures are validated on-chain with either [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) (if supported by the network) or smart contracts, without reliance on centralized infrastructure.  [Learn more here](/sdk/advanced/passkeys).
- Socials
  - ZeroDev supports social logins natively, but you can also use ZeroDev with [third-party auth providers](/sdk/signers/intro) such as Dynamic, Privy, and Magic if your prefer their UI.
- EOA
  - It's important to note that when a user signs in with an EOA (e.g. MetaMask) through ZeroDev, the EOA is not used as a wallet, but rather as the *signer* of the ZeroDev smart wallet.  Therefore, the address of the smart wallet is different than the address of the user's EOA.

### Passkeys

```ts
import { useCreateKernelClientPasskey } from "@zerodev/waas"

function App() {
  const { connectRegister, connectLogin, isPending } = useCreateKernelClientPasskey(
    { version: "v3" }
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        disabled={isPending}
        onClick={() => {
          // username of the passkey
          connectRegister({ username: "KERNEL_USER_NAME" }); 
        }}
      >
        Register
      </button>
      <button 
        disabled={isPending}
        onClick={() => {
          connectLogin();
        }}
      >
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

### Socials

```ts
```

### EOA

```ts
import { useCreateKernelClientEOA } from "@zerodev/waas"
import { useConnect } from "wagmi"

function App() {
  const { connectors } = useConnect();
  const { connect, isPending } = useCreateKernelClientEOA({ version: "v3" });

  return (
    <button
      disabled={isPending}
      onClick={() => {
        connect({ connector: connectors[0] })
      }} 
    >
      {"Create Smart Account"}
    </button>
  )
}
```
