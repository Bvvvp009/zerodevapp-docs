# Transaction Automation

With smart accounts, you can automate transactions for your users.  Some example use cases are:

- Subscriptions.
- Trading bots.
- Automatic order execution, e.g. limit orders & trailing orders.

In general, any time you wish you could execute a transaction for your user, you can use transaction automation.
