# Transaction Automation

With smart accounts, you can automate transactions for your users.  Some example use cases are:

- Subscriptions.
- Trading bots.
- Automatic order execution, e.g. limit orders & trailing orders.

In general, any time you wish to execute a transaction for your user, you can use transaction automation.

## How Transaction Automation Works

Thanks to smart accounts, transaction automation is *safe* with ZeroDev.  Your users delegate to you a specific set of [*permissions*](https://docs.zerodev.app/smart-wallet/permissions/intro) through [session keys](https://docs.zerodev.app/blog/session-keys-are-the-jwts-of-web3), so even if your server is hacked, your users's assets will be safe.
